THE SWAN (Figure 1) was a passenger vessel that usually sailed with passengers on the Mariager Inlet. In December 2019, the ship was chartered for a port in December for a period in December with passengers in the Port of Aarhus. The ship's crew consisted of the ship's master, a boatman and a cafe employee. On the evening of December 10, 2019, the ship sailed one harbor cruise with 47 passengers on board. Wind was blowing from the south, the air temperature was 4-5 C and the water temperature was 7-8 C. Kl. At 18.25 the Swan arrived at his berth at Hack Kampmanns Plads in the Port of Aarhus, where passengers were to disembark. While passengers were leaving, suddenly there was a gust of wind which caused the ship to drift so far over that the gangway slid off the ship and into the water. Three passengers, who were on the gangway, fell into the water. The crew launched the ship's readiness for overburden and phoned 112.

People on the quay threw lifeguards with a attached line down to them overboard passengers. Two of the fallen men grabbed the lifeline and stayed pulled over to a rescue ladder that was in front of the ship (Figure 2). After approx. 5 minutes in the water, two of the people in need came up to the rescue ladder with the help of people on the quay. Meanwhile, the ship's cafe employee grabbed the third overboard and tried to pull her up onto the ship. It soon became clear that this was not possible. Therefore, the ship became hoist boom rigged and a rescue harness lowered. The distressed man managed to put on the rescue harness, but she slipped out of the harness as the ship's driver tried to lift her out of the water with the hoist boom. The distressed person was quickly rebuffed in the cold water and had difficulty staying up. The cafe employee therefore jumped into the water and the distressed man reached over to the rescue ladder. The distressed person was then rebuked that it was not possible for her to get up the ladder with her own help. The boatman, who was on shore when the gangway bridge fell into the water, therefore crawled down the ladder in the water and helped the distressed person in collaboration with the cafe employee. The distressed at that time person had been in the water for approx. 10 minutes. The land-based emergency, which was requested via 112, arrived at the ship after the distressed had been rescued.","Passenger Ship","Ship remains fit to proceed","60.6","","","","3","47","","0","0","0","0","0","0","2020-03-25",""

The purging of Bow Dalian’s cargo tanks with nitrogen supplied from shoreside vehicles was then commenced in readiness for a ship-to-ship cargo transfer with Stolt Groenland.

At 1043, vapour started to release from the pressure vacuum valve for Stolt Groenland’s number 9 starboard (9S) cargo tank, which contained styrene monomer. About 2 minutes later, a highlevel alarm indicated that the level in 9S cargo tank had reached 95%, soon followed by a high-high-level alarm indicating that the level had increased to 98%. By now, Stolt Groenland’s on-watch deck ofcer and chief ofcer had made their way to the cargo control room and they saw from the cargo monitoring system that the pressure inside 9S cargo tank was rapidly rising. Suddenly, at 1050, two explosions were seen and heard in rapid succession in way of the tanker’s cargo manifold. The resulting fireball passed very close to a road bridge above the quay.","Chemical/Products Tanker","Ship rendered unfit to proceed","25881","DNV GL AS (DNVGL)","43478","Bulk Chemicals","25","","","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","2020-02-26",""

By way of background, the vessel was drydocked (High and Dry) at Slipway No. 1 of Varadero de Recodo since 24 April 2019, as a mandatory drydocking requirement and for the conduct of carpentry and below waterline repairs. Varadero de Recodo, Inc. is a Shipbuilding & Ship Repair facility classified as a Class C shipyard (CR-000807) registered under MARINA Regional Office IX – Zamboanga.
Based on initial information, smoke initially emitted at the main deck of the vessel at around 0127H of 09 August 2019. Thereafter, fire subsequently started to propagate and engulf the vessel.
At around 0143H, responders from Recodo Fire Sub-Station arrived at the area and immediately commenced fire-fighting. It was then divulged that the fire already consumed half portion of the main deck upon their arrival. Consequently, other fire and rescue authorities arrived on the site thereafter and the fire was then extinguished at about two (2) hours after.

The investigation revealed that the potential cause of the fire was electrical ignition due to short circuit. This was in consideration that the electrical wire connection connected to the adjacent shore-based electrical panel used for lighting purposes was chafed, thus having contact with a combustible material such as wood.
Consequences to the occurrence involves the total loss of MV “Nurhuda” with no reported fatalities or damage to the marine environment.","","Total loss of the ship","216.57","","","N/A","12","0","0","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","2020-06-19",""

The stevedore had likely leaned on a safety railing on the cross deck to check the condition of the container when the safety railing gave way.
The investigation found that the corroded condition of the safety railing had been identified by the Company at the time of takeover of the vessel’s safety

The crewmember was conveyed ashore for medical treatment by the Coast Guard but later succumbed to injuries at the hospital.

The investigation revealed that the crane cabin’s floor plate gave way which caused the crewmember to fall. The floor plate (as a part of the crane cabin floor) was found corroded with severe pitting along the welded joint which had thinned the material. The Company’s Planned Maintenance System (PMS) incorporated a quarterly inspection schedule recommended by the crane manufacturer. The crewmember who conducted the inspections, and operators of the crane, did not notice the corrosions of the floor plate over a period of time. The crane manufacturer deemed such inspections to only be carried out by their authorised and trained personnel. The crane manufacturer had not included the scope of inspection required for the crane cabin, including what was to be inspected and how the inspection was to be carried out. 

The design of the crane cabin required the operator to stand on the floor plate, albeit temporarily, adding weight on the plate which posed a risk to the operator, especially when the floor plate was corroded. The investigation team thus opined that the design of the crane cabin could be improved by providing additional load bearing support for the floor plate and on the design of the seat arrangement.","Container Ship (Fully Cellular)","Loss of life","27003","Nippon Kaiji Kyokai (NKK)","34577","Containerised ","24","0","0","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","2021-05-10",""

Around 2 p.m., after releasing his fishing gear for a 3rd line, the skipper raises the sorting table by the caliorne with the hydraulic controls located on the wheelhouse. He did not notice that the seaman on the port side was leaning over the table when he should have withdrawn. The seaman is trapped between the table that goes up and the port trawl reel. Alerted by the 2nd seaman, the skipper interrupts the maneuver and goes down to the deck to free the seaman who is inanimate. Given the severity of the injuries, the skipper alerted the emergency services. An attempt at resuscitation was initiated by the crew. The medical team was launched on board 1 hour 30 minutes after the accident and could only note the death of the seaman. During a routine operation of lifting the sorting table loaded with langoustines, a seaman was crushed between the table and the trawl reel above, causing his death. The post mortem toxicological analysis demonstrated that the seaman took a narcotic product at a toxic dose. Probably due to fainting, the seaman had his upper body on the sorting table. The skipper, having no visibility on the port side where the seaman was located, maintained the lifting action he commanded from the wheelhouse. This fatal accident reminds that the consumption of psychoactive substances endangers the health and safety of seafarers, especially when fishing. Furthermore, the layout and the absence of monitoring equipment on board did not allow the skipper to have a complete view of the working deck.","Fish Catching Vessel","Loss of life","43","","","","","0","","1","0","0","0","0","0","2020-02-17",""

The chief officer was still manoeuvring the dredger towards the berth when the master took a single step towards the quayside. The dredger was too far away from its berth, with the result that the masters foot missed the quay, and his upper body struck the chains and quayside with force before he fell between the quay wall and the vessel. He was crushed by the moving dredger before slipping into the water. The master was wearing a lifejacket and the ships crew were able to recover him from the water in about 10 minutes. The master was declared life extinct on the quayside. The postmortem examination report recorded that the master had sustained extensive injuries consistent with crushing. The MAIB investigation concluded that the system of work employed for self-mooring the vessel was inherently hazardous, and that: Linesmen were not used, but no measures had been taken to avoid having to place a crew member ashore while the vessel was unmoored. The crew routinely employed the practice of stepping ashore/on board when the vessel was not tight alongside. The master misjudged the distance between the vessel and the berth and attempted to step across too early.

1.2 At 18:45 on February 13, 2019, (local time from here forward, unless otherwise specified), the ship berthed at a pier of the Qingjian Terminal in the Port of Nanjing. From 21:30 that evening until the breakout of the fire, the crew worked on unloading asphalt. 
1.3 At 16:15 on February 14, 2019, the captain heard the fire alarm sounding onboard. He hurriedly climbed to the bridge and witnessed black smoke rising from the funnel. 
1.4 The captain immediately informed the crew of the fire and commanded them to assemble into a fire emergency team. 
1.5 The chief engineer, who had been repairing, with the third engineer, the expansion tank in the thermal oil heating system near the engine zone on the upper deck, also witnessed black smoke billowing out from under the engine room. 
1.6 The chief engineer pushed the remote emergency stop button to stop the engine room ventilator, various fuel oil pumps, and the thermal oil heating system from operating. He also turned off the various valves on the fuel oil tanks.  
1.7 There were four crew members inside the engine room at the time: the ship’s second engineer, Oiler B, first engineer, and Oiler C.  
1.8 Three of these crew members, excluding the second engineer, escaped the engine room safely and immediately after the fire began. 
1.9 Because the captain had received a report that the second engineer was still in the engine room, he did not use the fixed carbon dioxide firefighting system. 
1.10 The firefighting task force could not enter the engine room, despite wearing firefighting gear, due to the heat and the black smoke. They closed the engine room off and continued spraying seawater around it, waiting on the deck by the stern. 
1.11 As the smoke began to dissipate, the task force entered the engine room to check that there were no remaining flames. They discovered the second engineer, unconscious and out of his work clothes, in the front of the bottommost floor on the portside of the engine room at 17:10. 
1.12 The fire claimed the life of the second engineer, in addition to consuming the fluorescent light bulbs, the oily water separator, the lubricant cleaner, and the control panel for the main engine near the fuel oil overflow tank heating line.

The investigation revealed that steering gear compartment of the vessel had suffered a breach while she was enroute. The breach, which had gone unnoticed, resulted in the steering gear compartment filling up with sea water, which subsequently caused water to enter the engine room compartment and disabled the vessel.  
 
The investigation also revealed that there were no requirements for the installation of bilge alarm for the vessel under the regulations she was certified, and there was no process in place for the crew to check on the condition of the steering gear compartment during the voyage.
