EBRO struck P&O NEDLLOYD GENOA on its aft starboard side in the stern area at a height of approx. 6m above the waterline over a length of approx. 25m and a width of approx. 2 to 3m.  The damage consisted of heavy paint abrasion and denting, as well as minor holes in the hull on a level with the frames. As a result of the collision the container vessel became stranded on a level with buoy 80 at river km 675.5.  After it came free with the rising tide at about 11.25h, the vessel was able to continue its voyage. On EBRO the starboard bulwark was set in over a length of 10 to 12m.  Furthermore, two frames in the foreship area were cracked/torn.  The vessel continued its voyage.
No personal injuries were sustained and there was no water ingress.  No tanks were damaged and therefore there was no environmental pollution. Only property damage was sustained.","CONTAINER SHIP","Ship remains fit to proceed","31333","Germanischer Lloyd (GL)","37845","","21","","1","","","","","","","2007-03-08","2008-07-01"

On 9 December 2002, the Master made the decision to conduct an abandon ship drill before the vessel was due to depart for Geelong.  The drill commenced at about 1540 and the starboard lifeboat was prepared for lowering to the water.
At approximately 1548 the Mate reported that the crew inside the lifeboat were seated and had fastened their safety belts.  Lowering of the boat commenced with one of the crew operating the davit winch brake from the deck.  When the boat had been lowered approximately two meters from the davit head the after on-load release hook suddenly opened, releasing the after fall.  The lifeboat's stern fell to leave the boat suspended vertically by the remaining forward fall with its stern swinging approximately five meters above the water.  The boat crew were shaken by the incident but remained secured in their seats inside the now vertical lifeboat.  The second mate had sustained a small cut over his left eye.
After the crew had disembarked, the lifeboat was lowered to the water to allow the on-load release system to be inspected.","BULK CARRIER","Ship remains fit to proceed","10490","Lloyd's Register (LR)","16860","","27","","","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","2007-03-16","2008-06-30"

The crew investigated this oil loss and tried to control the situation. They were not successful and water started to leak into the engine room from the inner stern tube seals.

The master of the vessel contacted the owners and advised of the danger of the engine room flooding with water through the leaking stern tube.

The main engine was stopped and the vessel was left to drift and tug assistance was requested.

On 21 October 2002 at 0630, the tugboat OLYMPIA of TSAVLIRIS SALVAGE secured the tow and took the MV INDONESIA STAR under tow.

The vessels arrived at Kingston roads were the MV INDONESIA STAR anchored.  Later on the vessel was dry-docked and repairs affected at Curacao.

The autopilot was not functioning, so the skipper shared the steering duties with the deckhand, the only other crew member on board. At about 16.00 hours LT on 1st September  the skipper noticed that the engine was losing power, and saw black smoke coming from the hatches, but could not locate the source of the problem. He decided to turn TAMARA's head to the sea, but as the vessel turned a huge wave washed over the stern and a large amount of water was trapped on the work deck. This flowed quickly into the open steering hatch and through into the ice room and engine room. The mechanical and electrical bilge pumps were operated, but they could not keep up with the rapid inflow of water, and it became evideent that the vessel was going to sink. Both men dived into the sea, and watched the vessel sink. Shortly afterwards the liferaft stowed on the wheel house surfaced and the two men climbed into it. The life raft held a survival pack which kept them going for many days, but despite ships coming into view none of them noticed the flares that the two men set off and it was not until 9th September, when the skipper's friend reported that the TAMARA  was overdue at Nournea, that rescue services were alerted. However, it was not until 14 September 2002 that the two men were found drifting in a liferaft 30 miles east of Moreton Island,  Queensland, by the fishing vessel Devocean. The authorities were contacted and the men were subsequently airlifted to hospital in Brisbane.

Additionally, the Fitter was severely burned and had to be evacuated to receive medical treatment.  It was reported that the explosion happened as the Chief Officer and Second Officer were attempting to open a steam valve that had been stuck and not working properly.  Their proximity to the steam line led to their being fatally scalded and thrown through the engine room.  Because the Fitter was standing further away, he was able to survive the blast.","Oil Tanker","Loss of life,Serious injuries","58853","","107632","","","","","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","2006-12-08","2008-07-02"

She could not be contacted and a search and rescue operation began immediately
Flamingo’s upturned hull was located, and the bodies of two of the four crew members were picked up. Neither was wearing a lifejacket.
The hull drifted with the tide until the following afternoon, when it was attempted to tow her towards a nearby sandbank, with the intention of beaching her.
She sank shortly after the tow began

The purpose of the drill was to demonstrate the vessel's safety organisation to the Swedish Maritime Safety Inspectorate.  In particular it was to be shown how in an emergency situation passengers could be evacuated from the passenger accommodation on deck 2, which is below the vehicle deck.  On board were a full crew and a group of observers from the Maritime Safety Inspectorate.  In addition, the shipping company had engaged 318 supernumeraries who were to act as passengers.
When the supernumeraries and observers had taken their places on board, the drill started with the fiction that a fire had broken out in an engine-room at the bottom of the vessel.  In the introductory phase the crew were alerted and a fire-fighting group was sent out to engage the fire.  The passengers were informed that the ship was to be evacuated.  Closure of the vessel's watertight doors (WT doors) was activated from the bridge, whereupon two doors that were open, shut automatically.  These were located in the passenger area on deck 2.
When the fire-fighting group arrived in the engine-room they discovered a man standing caught in a WT door.  He was released and life-saving measures were started.  However, he was found to be dead.  The dead man was an electrical engineer, well familiar with the vessel and with the operation of its WT doors.  He was employed temporarily to carry out electrical work.","PASSENGER/RORO CARGO/FERRY","Loss of life","23842","DNV AS (DNV)","2700","","42","318","7","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","2006-12-15","2008-07-02"

A 3 metre gash was sustained in the port side shell plating below the water line leading to a large ingress of water into the lower cargo hold.
The vessel was moved into the lock and shortly after, began to list to starboard, reaching a maximum heel of 14.5° at 0333. Firefighters and a local salvage team attended and , after several hours, the ingress of water was slowed and the water level in the lower hold reduced. The quick and effective action of the firefighters and salvors prevented a capsize.
The vessel was moved to berth no4 where she was all fast at 1442. An MAIB inspector arrived at the vessel shortly after she berthed to commence the investigation.

Several days later, the tug ATLANTIC MAPLE took the vessel into tow and steamed towards St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador.  The tug and tow encountered adverse weather and were forced to seek refuge in Trinity Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador.  When the weather finally moderated, the tow resumed.  On the morning of 30 March 2002, while approximately six nautical miles north-west of Cape St. Francis, Newfoundland and Labrador, the KATSHESHUK listed and sank in position 47º54.3'N, 052º49.5'W.
