At about 03:30 hours, with the ship trawling in a north-north-westerly direction, the Skipper handed over to a deckhand and went below to get some sleep. 
Shortly before 04:00 hours, the Skipper was aroused by a shout from the deckhand. Scrambling up into the wheelhouse, he saw the bow of a ship very close on the starboard bow and only had time to brace himself before the stem of Moonshot came in contact with the port bow of the ship. Moonshot was pushed around to port, heeling dangerously to port as the starboard fishing boom came in contact with the side of the ship. As the ship passed clear, the deckhand saw the word ISTANBUL on its stern. 
The ship did not stop, or respond to the Skipper's calls on VHF 16. 
Moonshot received damage to the stem and starboard bow, also to the starboard fishing boom. After ascertaining that the ship was not taking water, the crew retrieved the fishing gear, then returned to Townsville for Moonshot to undergo repairs. 
The Turkish bulk carrier Gumbet was on a ballast passage from Hong Kong to Geelong and had disembarked the Barrier Reef pilot off Cairns at 12:30 hours on Thursday 12 December 1996. 
When the Master went to the bridge at 06:30 hours on 13 December, for his customary morning check, he was informed that the Second Mate had experienced a close quarters situation with a fishing ship at 03:40 hours, off Tink Shoal. The Master telexed a brief account of the reported incident to the ship's owner. 
When Gumbet arrived at Geelong on 18 December, it bore signs of a recent contact between the light and load water lines on the port bow

The sub-agent in Gaspé was not successful in securing the services of an individual with previous pilotage experience, and a representative of the sub-agent boarded the Ypapadi to assist the master in his approach to the berth. A lack of communication between this person and the master led each to believe that the other had the conduct of the ship. In the approach to the berth at a position where a large course alteration was required, neither gave the appropriate order to the quartermaster, and the ship grounded on the north side of the harbour.

On deck, routine maintenance was being conducted by some of the students. 
Shortly before 11:45 hours on 5 December, one of the students, using a rotary grinder, was removing rust from the door of the battery locker, which was situated at deck level, in the after housing, below the wheelhouse. He paused and called over the Bosun's Mate who looked at the work before turning away and walking towards the forward housing. At that instance, the Bosun's Mate recalled being ""moved"" over a metre, putting her hands over her ears and hearing a noise. Another student, working on the port side about 5 metres from the bridge front, saw a dark shape, which he took to be a body, being thrown over the port rail. 
The Master, who was on watch and fixing the ship's position at the time, and most of the crew heard an explosion and went to the deck. Within a very few seconds life buoys were thrown overboard, one with a smoke marker. The Master could see the student in the water close to the smoke buoy, but as he watched the student disappeared from view. 
Within 3 minutes, a rescue boat was launched and was making for the smoke buoy and Concordia was turned about. No trace of the student could be found, except for a pair of shoes on the deck and some evidence of blood on the deck, on the ship's rail and near the ship's side. 
The maritime rescue authorities were alerted and Concordia, assisted by a helicopter and a fixed wing aircraft, searched the area that afternoon, into the evening until 19:15 hours. The following morning the search resumed at sunrise and Concordia was later joined by a single fixed wing aircraft. The search for the student was abandoned at about 12:30 hours, and after a short service Concordia resumed passage for Darwin.

At about 0100 Eastern Australian Standard Time on 26 November, the Skipper anchored the vessel in about 75 m of water in position 39° 7.88’ South 145° 19.25’ East, about 33 miles south of Phillip Island. The vessel switched on its anchor light and the Skipper and one of the deck hands went to bed, leaving one deck hand on watch.
At or a little after 0200, the deck hand noticed the lights of a ship approaching from an easterly direction. He realised that the vessel was bearing down towards Ester J and he immediately called the Skipper. The Skipper started the fishing vessel’s engine and called the unidentified vessel on channel 16 VHF, with no response. There was no time to weigh anchor or cut the cable, so he put the engine full astern, but the two vessels collided at about 0215.
The fishing vessel sustained damage to the port side. The large vessel did not stop or make any attempt to call Ester J. A quick inspection of the damage showed the vessel was not in immediate danger of sinking
Ester J’s Skipper called Melbourne Maritime Communications Centre on the radio frequency 4125 kHz, reporting the incident. He then called his home by mobile telephone.
Nobody was injured and no pollution resulted from the collision.
The hull remained watertight and the engine was operational, so the Skipper set course for San Remo, where the vessel arrived safely at 0800 on 26 November.

The ship anchored to the port anchor with 5 shackles on deck in about 12 m of water. The ship's draught was 6.3 m forward and 7.25 m aft. Sea watches were maintained on the bridge and the engine was put on 20 minutes notice. The ship was due to berth at about 06:00hours on 18 November 1996.
At 12:20 hours on 17 November, the chemical tanker Sampet Hope anchored with Point Gellibrand bearing 346 x 1.35 miles. The anchor position was about 4.5 cables north and east of Columbus Victoria. The tanker had a cargo of non-volatile (kerosene type) solvent in four centre tanks. The weather at this time was fair with a south-south-west to south-west wind at about 8 knots. Sea watches were maintained on the bridge and the engine was left on instant (3-4 minutes) readiness.
From about 14:00 hours on 17 November, the wind backed and increased in strength. At 18:00, the wind speed was recorded at the Harbour Control Centre as west of south at 17-25 knots. By 22:00, the wind was noted as southerly at 21-31 knots, gusting to 35 knots, with rain. The sea at the anchorage was described as ""short and choppy"".
At about 22:15 hours, the officer of the watch aboard ""Columbus Victoria"" detected the ship was dragging anchor, the Master was called and the engine room given notice that the engine was required.
At about 22:20 hours, the officer of the watch on Sampet Hope realised that Columbus Victoria was dragging anchor and that risk of collision existed. He called the Master and at 22:26 hours the engine was ordered. At about 22:30 hours, crew members of ""Sampet Hope"" were deploying fenders as the container ship approached. The engine and bow thrust were ready for use.
At a time put at between 22:32 and 22:33 hours, the two vessels collided. The initial impact was taken forward of the tanker's collision bulkhead, on the bulbous bow and the flare of the starboard bow. At about this time ""Columbus Victoria"" let go the other anchor, but it did not arrest the drift.
A second impact occurred at 22:36 hours. By using the bow thrust, engine and rudder, Sampet Hope cleared Columbus Victoria at 22:40 hours and the tanker weighed anchor at 22:52 hours and the master repositioned the ship.
At about 22:40 hours, the engine on Columbus Victoria was ready for manoeuvring. At 22:50 hours, the ship started to manoeuvre and weighed anchor at 23:05 hours, re-anchoring at 23:30 hours with 7 shackles in the water to the south of its original position.

She completed loading and securing the cargo at 03:50 hours on 13 November 1996 and sailed at 08:30 that day, bound for Cape town with 29 crew onboard.
The weather on sailing was reasonable but deteriorated during the day with a strong to (later)  gale force South Westerly wind and a high South Westerly Swell. 
The master spoke to his Agents in Durban at about 21:00 hours that evening and reported that he was progressing slowly into the South Westerly gale but that everything was fine. At 22:24 hours, the master contacted Durban Radio and reported that she was taking water rapidly in number 1 hold and that she required immediate assistance. He gave her position as 31° 21’S and 30° 01’E.
Radio contact was immediately therefore lost. 
The Coast Radio Station immediately transmitted a “May-day-Relay” message and a number of ships arrived on scene at about 00:45 hours on 14 November 1996. Some debris, oil, 2 empty liferafts and 2 empty lifeboats were spotted during the night, but no sign of any survivors. At first light a full scale air and sea Search and Rescue operation was launched. Five bodies were spotted, but because of the extreme weather and sea conditions these could not be recover by the helicopters or surface craft.
The lost of the ship cause a substantial oil slick and large areas of the shore of the Eastern Cape were contaminated.
The wreck of the ship was later located in position 31° 21.86 and 30° 01.85’E in a depth of 86 metres.

Due to the ship's light condition, the unloader could not be positioned over No. 1 hold, to remove the 1080 tonnes of cargo remaining in that particular hold. At the suggestion of the shift supervisor, ballast was pumped into No. 4 hold, which was permissible under the ship's operations manual. Pumping of ballast into No. 4 hold commenced at 05:30 hours.
After the lunch break, two terminal workers descended into No. 5 hold, where the unloader was working, to clear iron ore from around the bottom of the forward spiral access ladder. The spiral ladder terminated at the top of the lower stool, six metres above the tank top. They had just completed this task and were about to climb the ladder when the bulkhead to the starboard side of the centre line, between No. 5 hold and the ballasted No. 4 hold, collapsed. Both workers were immediately engulfed by the deluge and, although one was able to haul himself clear, the other remained submerged.
The shift supervisor was working in his office ashore and, alerted by calls over the radio from the Hatchman, dashed on board and immediately descended the ladder into No. 5 hold. Up to his neck in the swirling water and guided by the Hatchman above, he was able to grab hold of the submerged worker. Assisted by another terminal worker, who had followed him into the hold, he was able to haul the unconscious and apparently lifeless worker clear of the water. The shift supervisor then administered cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), which was successful in restoring breathing in the worker. Very shortly afterwards an ambulance officer arrived on the scene and administered oxygen, before the worker was lifted from the hold and taken to hospital.
To identify the circumstances which led to the collapse of the bulkhead, the ship's procedures and documentation were examined. Also a detailed examination of the bulkhead between holds 4 and 5 was undertaken, which included a metallurgical examination and finite element analyses of the failed bulkhead.

At 08:00 hours, the ship was in the position 37°22 S, 131°50 E, approximately 240 nautical miles WSW of Kangaroo Island. At about 08:00 hours, the Second Engineer reported to the bridge that sunlight could be seen coming into the forecastle through the small “booby” hatch on the forecastle head. 
The Chief Officer, after leaving the bridge, made his way forward along the main deck to investigate, taking the Bosun and two Able Seamen (ABs) with him. He had not advised the Third Mate, now on watch on the bridge, nor anybody else, that he was going to the forecastle. He had no radio with him. The four men went onto the forecastle where they found the lid of the booby hatch had been torn off. Attempts to replace it proved fruitless, as it was distorted, so the Chief Officer sent the Bosun to get materials with which to improvise a hatch cover. 
Shortly after this, a green sea swept the forecastle, carrying one AB right over the top of the windlass and the other AB against the front of it. The Chief Officer was swept underneath the windlass. The AB who had been swept over the windlass, stunned, called out to the other two who did not reply. He, thinking they had been washed overboard, made his way off the forecastle and told the Bosun what had happened. The Bosun sent the duty AB to the bridge to inform the Officer of the Watch of a man overboard situation. 
The Officer of the Watch commenced a Williamson turn and sounded the “man overboard” alarm. Shortly before 09:00 hours, while the vessel had started searching for the men believed overboard, the other AB, recovering on the forecastle, found the Chief Officer under the windlass. Making his way aft he told the Bosun that the Chief Officer was still on the forecastle. The Chief Officer was stretchered aft to the ship’s hospital. He had suffered severe head and chest injuries and a broken leg. It was found later that the two ABs had not sustained serious injury. At 09:45 hours, the MRCC in Canberra was contacted asking for medical advice and for the nearest port for a medevac of all three. 
Those tending the Chief Officer were unable to stem the profuse bleeding from his head injuries. In spite of prolonged CPR and the administering of oxygen, all vital signs had disappeared by 13:30 hours and it was concluded that he had died at some time before that. The ship resumed its course to Fremantle where it arrived on the evening of 19 August 1996.

The ship was due to berth at 06:00 hours the following morning to load 7,600 tonnes of rock phosphate. 
Christmas Island is “steep to” and ships do not anchor but drift while waiting to berth. Niaga 46 hove to in position with North West Point bearing 270 x 2.5 miles, to drift overnight. Sea watches were maintained and the engine was on ten minutes notice of readiness. The wind was blowing from a southerly direction at 17 knots and the anticipated current was west going at about 2 knots. 
By 21:32 hours, the ship had drifted west towards North West Point and the Third Mate decided to reposition the ship. At 23:23 hours, Niaga 46 was repositioned about 2.5 miles due east of North West Point. 
At midnight, the Second Mate had not arrived on the bridge so the Third Mate handed over the watch to the 12-4 apprentice and left the bridge at about 00:05 hours. The Second Mate arrived on the bridge at about 00:10 hours and switched on the starboard radar to check the ship’s position. The radar showed Niaga 46 as being close to the land east of North West Point. He rang the duty engineer and requested use of the engine. The engine was ready at 00:39 hours, however, before the Second Mate could manoeuvre clear of the land the ship grounded at 00:47 hours about 6 cables east of North West Point. 
At 06:05 hours, contact was made with the Harbour Master, Christmas Island, and he boarded the ship a little after 07:00 hours on 9 August. The Harbour Master took charge of the refloating operation and, after a number of unsuccessful attempts, the vessel was refloated at 23:00 hours on 9 August. 
The ship suffered extensive damage and was taken in tow to a repair port in Indonesia

At 1619, the visibility was further reduced and current in the area became confusing to interpret and thus the Master ordered half ahead and then slow ahead to keep headway. At approximately 1626, a contact was identified on the radar which was set at the 3-6 mile range. The contact was 30° on the starboard bow and was about 1.3 miles away. This was the first time the contact was noticed. The third Officer attempted to locate the vessel using the ARPA but the vessel was too small to be detected. Attempts were made, via radio, to contact the vessel in question; no answer was received. At approximately 1630 the lookout noticed a black shadow on the starboard bow and immadiately collided with the KOREX INCHON. 

The KOREX INCHON was capsized as a result of the collision and all 10 people onboard were rescued by the SEA SPARKLE. The SEA SPARKLE was surveyed for damages and was later allowed to off load its remaining cargo then proceed to Shanghai for repair.

At about 01:55 hours on 18 July 1996, the ship grounded on Piper Reef at full speed, in a position 100 metres eastward of the light beacon. Initial attempts to refloat the her by going astern on the engine were unsuccessful. 
Peacock remained stranded on Piper Reef until the late afternoon of 26 July 1996, when salvors successfully refloated the ship after having transferred some of the fuel oil bunkers to a barge. 
The ship’s hull was not breached and no pollution occurred. However, machinery tests showed that only one steering motor was fully functional, therefore Peacock was towed to Cairns for necessary repairs.

By 01:00 hours on 10 July, River Embley was approaching Little Fitzroy Light at a speed of 16 knots. At about 01:15 hours, three ships were seen north west of Little Fitzroy Light, on River Embley’s port bow, the closest and the only one liable to pass close to River Embley was at a distance of 8 miles. At about 01:19 hours, River Embley altered course from 344 to 320 on the track to Low Isles. 
At about 23:30 hours on the night of 9 July 1996, the fishing ship “Bronze Wing” sailed from Cairns for Gibson Reef, about 46 miles south-south- east of Cairns, to collect aquarium fish. The ship cleared Cairns fairway channel and set course for Cape Grafton. From a position about a mile off Cape Grafton and making good a speed of between 6 knots and 7 knots, the ship was to follow a predetermined track to a position between 1 mile and 1.6 miles off Little Fitzroy Lighthouse. At about 01:19 hours, the Deckhand on watch on board Bronze Wing saw a large ship on the starboard bow at 6 miles on the radar and confirmed the ship’s location by a visual sighting. 
The two ships collided at about 01:34 hours, with the starboard bow of the fishing ship coming into contact with the starboard side of River Embley’s hull, forward of mid length. Bronze Wing suffered significant damage, but River Embley’s paint work was only superficially scratched. Nobody suffered any significant injury and no pollution resulted. 
After the collision the two ships contacted each other by VHF Radio. When it was determined that Bronze Wing did not require assistance and would return to Cairns under her own power, River Embley resumed course for Weipa.

The fire was fought initially by a fire-fighting party using foam. When forced to retire due to the building up of heat and smoke, the engine room was evacuated, sealed off and flooded with carbon dioxide. The fire was extinguished 54 minutes after initial detection.

The build up of heat caused the generators, including the emergency generator, to shut down automatically, and the ship was without main electrical power for a short time. Emergency lighting was powered by batteries when the generators stopped. 

The Master alerted the United States Coastguard, who, in association with Transport Canada arranged for assistance to be provided. The ship was taken under tow and there were no injuries, loss of life or pollution arising from the incident. 

The United States Coastguard and Transport Canada participated in the investigation conducted by the Bahamas Maritime Authority.

On board, in addition to the permanent and volunteer crew, were 31 trainees, mainly young unemployed persons, drawn from all over the Northern Territory and sponsored by the Commonwealth Employment Service. 
Shortly after 08:30 hours, a team of three trainees, led by their Watch Leader, climbed aloft on the mainmast, to release the gaskets securing the main gaff topsail, so the sail could be set. The second of the three trainees, a woman in her late twenties, fell as she negotiated the futtock shrouds. Although she had clipped on her safety line, the free end of her safety belt slipped through the buckle and she fell 18 metres to the deck. 
Fortunately, the fall was partially broken by the nock sail sheet. Even so, the trainee suffered severe multiple fractures to her knees and to her thighs, also a collapsed lung. A helicopter medivac was arranged to transfer her to the Royal Darwin Hospital, where she remained in intensive care for 16 days.

As the vessel came under control the Master attempted to steer the vessel between two ships in the Belle Chasse anchorage. The Master realized that he was too close to the West bank of the river to clear the starboard sides of the anchored vessels so he attempted to pass on the port. At 1614, the SANKO QUEST fouled the starboard anchor chain of the MOSLAVINA and collided with the vessel's starboard side. There were no injuries and no pollution as a result of this casualty.

Midas was anchored about 1 miles to the north of Bogasari Dua. 
At about 04:00 hours, Bogasari Dua, lying to a single starboard anchor with eight shackles in 30 m of water, began to drag anchor in gale force southerly winds and was driven towards Midas. Those on the bridge of Bogasari Dua did not realise that the ship was dragging anchor until after 04:30 hours, when they were alerted by the whistle signals of Midas. Bogasari Dua came into contact with Midas at about 04:45 hours, before either the anchor could be weighed, or the engine made ready. As soon as the two ships moved apart, at about 04:50 hours, the Master of Bogasari Dua manoeuvred his ship clear. 
Bogasari Dua received damage to port side shell plating in way of no.5 hold, to the main deck bulwark on the port side, to the port side accommodation ladder hoist, to the port side lifeboat davit base and to the port lifeboat, which was split into three sections. Midas received indentation damage to the bulbous bow, also to shipside plating in way of nos. one and two starboard topside tanks and damage to various lengths of shipside railing. 
No one was injured in the incident and no pollution occurred.

At about 07:00 hours, the fire alarm panel in the wheel house indicated a fire in the seismic compressor room space and smoke could be seen coming from the vents.
The fire fighting tug, Total Endeavour, was sent to the scene in response to a request from the master and, using its fire monitors, applied boundary cooling to the hull while the crew continued boundary cooling on board.
The fire was extinguished at about 10:45 hours.

It was ballasted. The Pilot came on board at 22:10 hours. At that time there was fog and the visibility was approximately one cable. There was drift-ice in the area. The ship was travelling at approximately 11 knots with radar working on range 1.5 NM. The fog thickened successively after 23:05 hours. 

When the ship approached the Galklubb light, where a starboard turn of approximately 15 degrees was planned, and the radar range was changed to 0.75 NM. At that point the drift-ice around Galklubb caused the radar screen to become cluttered. There was no visual with the light or the red buoy north of it. At approximately the same time that the turn was executed the green buoy outside Ramsholmen's northern point was sighted close on starboard side. It was apparent then, that the ship had passed on the wrong side of the buoy and rudder hard to starboard was instantly executed. However, the ship ran onto and over the north western shallows of the islet of Ramsholmen. As a result the alarm sounded in the engine room and the engine crew stopped the main engine. On the bridge rudder hard to port was executed, but the ship continued across the fairway. The ship was crash anchored, but ran aground bow first at the Sankhällans light, which was struck and sunk.
