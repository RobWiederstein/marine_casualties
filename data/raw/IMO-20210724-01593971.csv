After the loading works had been completed on Sunday evening, the vessel left Eikefet shortly before 09:00h on Monday 19 January 2004, with a pilot on board and proceeded to bunker in Skalevik near Bergen, where she moored at 11:40h.  Four hours later, at about 15:40h, mv ROCKNES continued its voyage, still with a pilot on board, heading for the intended port of discharge in Emden, Germany.
At about 16:23h, mv ROCKNES changed course to port in order to enter Vatlestraumen. At about 16:27h the vessel touched ground with her starboard side in the narrow passage; immediately she developed a list to starboard that could not be stopped.  Within a few minutes mv ROCKNES capsized completely.
Twelve of the thirty persons on board could be recovered alive as a result of the rescue measures initiated immediately.  Three of them were freed from the hull of the vessel floating keel upwards after several hours.
Escaping fuel polluted Vatlestraumen and the adjacent coastline.  The Norwegian Coastal Authority collected a total of 1.291 tons of emulsified water which has been determined to be equivalent to 227,5 tons of IFO 380.
After the rescue attempts were discontinued, the vessel was towed into a bay on Agotnes.  The hull of the vessel was examined and it was decided to upright mv ROCKNES again.  From 17 March 2004 onwards work proceeded on turning the vessel; on 29 March 2004 it was lying upright again.  On 5 April 2004 mv ROCKNES was towed to the Bergen Mekaniske yard at Laksevag near Bergen.  The vessel was inspected and a decision was taken to reinstate it.  To this end mv ROCKNES was towed to Poland for repairs and modifications.  It was initially estimated that the necessary repair works would take more than one and a half years.","Bulk Dry (general, ore) Carrier","Ship rendered unfit to proceed,Pollution,Loss of life","17765","Germanischer Lloyd (GL)","25065","","23","","7","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","2007-05-25","2008-01-22"

Another trawler out of Le Guilvinec was fishing in the same area.  The two vessels were in the habit of working the same waters and called each other frequently on VHF radio.
The BUGALED BREIZH called the other trawler twice to say that she was capsizing and to give her position, contact was then lost and the vessel went down with loss of all hands; the other fishing vessel raised the alarm.
MRCC Falmouth deployed numerous aerial and maritime rescue resources.  Of the five crew members of the BUGALED BREIZH, two bodies were found on the same day, a third body was found in the wreck when it was refloated.
Three days after the sinking, the wreck of the BUGALED BREIZH was located and filmed by the camera of an MDV from a french minesweeper; she was subsequently refloated by court order in July 2004.","Fish Catching Vessel","Total loss of the ship,Loss of life","103.93","","","","5","","","5","0","0","0","0","0","2007-11-01","2008-07-01"

The catastrophic damage caused resulted in the vessel being declared a constructive total loss (CTL), two crew members were tragically killed and one was injured.

The “Panama Serena” had arrived at Porto Torres on 31 December 2003 with a cargo of Benzene and cut C6 (C6), the Benzene discharge had been complete and the vessel was close to completion of discharge of the C6. All cargo tanks were loaded upon arrival at Porto Torres, except No.4C which was washed, clean and dry.

At approximately 11:55 on 01 January 2004, as the cargo deck watch was changing, the vessel was shaken by the first in a series of violent explosions, which resulted in an intense fire amidships, within the cargo tank area of the vessel.

The duty 3rd Mate and relieving 2nd Mate were handing over the cargo watch in the cargo control room (CCR), which overlooked the main deck at the time of the first explosion. The seaman on duty and the seaman taking over the deck watch were outside on the main deck and were both tragically killed in the series of explosions. The Chief Mate, who was resting in his cabin at the time, was injured.

The Master and the remainder of the crew who were all within the aft accommodation area managed to escape from the vessel by jumping over the stern into the water, then climbing into the stern launch freefall lifeboat, which had automatically launched due to the extreme force of the explosions which wracked the vessel. 

The fire was eventually brought under control by the shore based emergency fire services; however they were unable to save the two seamen o the main deck or prevent extensive damage to the vessel and the terminal jetty due to the intense nature of the fire which followed the series of explosion.

Due to the catastrophic damage caused to the vessel (which can be seen in the photographs attached to this report) it has been extremely difficult to identify the exact cause of the initial explosion; however a number of possible causes were identified and are covered within this report.

The vessel grounded during maximum speed endurance trials, while making a speed of 38 knots and approaching a turn on the most westerly section of a planned 32-mile circuit of the Solent. The accident occurred towards the end of a long day of trials.  The Chief Officer had become distracted by another person in the operating compartment, and a turn was started too late, causing the vessel to momentarily ground on a shingle spit.

This crew member, who had primarily been assigned to Second Engineer functions, had last been seen alive in the engine room two days earlier, on 24 October 2003, between 17:30 hours and approximately 18:00, following completion of repairs carried out during the port call at Savannah (Georgia/USA). The engineer was reported missing at the latest at approximately 20:30, when he unexpectedly did not report at the ship’s board Management Centre (BMC) for the preparations of port departure manoeuvres planned for 21:00. Initial searches in the engine room and in the superstructure areas, including in the engineer’s room, were stopped at around 21:00 and the general alarm was sounded. Subsequent interrogation of all crew members and a search and the search of the ship were equally unsuccessful. Ship’s command therefore assumed that the Engineer had undoubtedly left the ship to go to ashore and had not returned on board. At 21:30 hours the Master therefore decided to clear the berth in Savannah for another container ship already within visual range and to start on the sea voyage to Norfolk

The sub-contractor arrived in Freeport on 26 September 2003.  He undertook safety training with the shipyard's Health and Safety Department.  Training included Permit to Work procedures, entry into confined spaces and accident reporting procedures.  He also set up his chemical cleaning equipment but it is unclear what arrangements were made to ventilate the boiler, to release the evolved gases to atmosphere. 
The chemical used to remove the boiler scale and corrosion was Unitor's Descalex.  This inhibited sulphamic acid cleaner also contained a colouring agent to indicate the acid strength.  The inhibitor provided a protective coating on the internal steel surfaces of the boiler so that it was protected from acid attack, which produces hydrogen gas.   
The sub-contractor started to heat up the water in the water/acid mixing tank at about 0800 on 10 October.  He then circulated the water to check the system integrity.  The cleaner was introduced to an overseer, a Danish national chemical cleaning expert, later in the morning.  The overseer mentioned that he had not previously used sulphamic acid and was sceptical that it would clean the boiler.  The sub-contractor discussed the cleaning procedure and gave the overseer a copy of the procedure he was using.  The instructions were not for the Descalex product but for the Drew Marine (UK ) Ltd cleaner - SAF-Acid.   At 1300 the temperature of the water/acid mixing tank was 570C and the overseer recommended that heating be stopped.  By mid afternoon, 800 kg of the cleaning chemical had been added and was being circulated around the boiler.  At 1700 the overseer tested the water/acid mixture; the result confirmed that the inhibitors were still protecting the steel surfaces.  At 2100 a further test was carried out, and this time the indications were that protection had ceased and the acid was dissolving the boiler steel.  While the sub-contractor was sceptical of the result he agreed to stop circulating the water/acid, as recommended by the overseer.
At 2145 the sub-contractor arranged for the steam drum door to be removed, having already reduced the water/acid mixture level in the boiler.  At 2200 both men approached the steam drum door.  No tests were conducted to check the steam drum atmosphere for either toxic or flammable gases.  The sub-contractor picked up a nearby, non-intrinsically safe, halogen lamp and placed it just inside the steam drum.  The overseer saw a small flame and an explosion immediately followed.  The sub-contractor was thrown backwards for about 4.5 metres; he was unconscious and had severe burns.  The overseer was also burnt but less severely.  There was no fire or severe damage to either paintwork or structure.  
Both men were evacuated, first to a local hospital and then on to Florida, USA.  The overseer eventually recovered but sadly, the sub-contractor died of his injuries on 19 October.  

All the evidence points to an accumulation of hydrogen gas in the steam drum which evolved during the cleaning procedure.  As the steam drum door was opened the air combined with the hydrogen to create a mixture that was within the hydrogen explosive limits.  As the sub-contractor introduced the halogen lamp, either the hot lens or bulb, or an electrical spark from the lamp ignited the mixture causing the explosion.

On 29 September, the crew was awakened by strong winds from the south-southeast. The weather was deteriorating rapidly with the approach of the tropical storm Juan.
During a manoeuvre to leave the anchorage, the Evan Richard started to ship water. A short time later, the after deck was flooded and a Mayday was broadcast as the she quickly settled. The occupants sought refuge on top of the wheelhouse which was the only part of the ship still above water. While attempting to swim to the inflatable boat that the Evan Richard was towing as a lifeboat, the master fell in the water and drifted towards the island.
The Evan Richard was driven onto the beach of Anticosti Island about 3 nautical miles from the position where the Mayday was broadcast. The master was picked up on the shore by a Search and Rescue helicopter, but the other two persons are still missing.

En route to Yemen, the vessel called at Singapore for bunkers, taking onboard ship’s spares and provisions, carrying out class surveys Anchorage, Singapore at 1648 on 21 September 2003.

At 2200 the third officer tested the navigational equipment, steering gear and main engine. He then reported to VTIS, Singapore on VHF regarding the vessel’s readiness and intention to leave the anchorage and proceed to sea. The VTIS informed the SEA LIBERTY of the prevailing tidal condition and asked the vessel to change VHF channel and report to channel 14.

At this time, the Master was on the bridge and in command of the watch. At 2229, the anchor was weighed up and the vessel proceeded at Dead Slow Ahead. At 2242 the Master of the SEA LIBERTY ordered full ahead. By 2312, the SEA LIBERTY joined the westbound traffic lane in the Singapore Straits and was steering a course of 2480T. The vessel was making some 12.5 knots with a favourable prevailing sea current. 

Between 2330 and 2335, the Master received traffic information from VTIS about two ships coming from the eastern anchorage in Singapore. The vessels were later identified visually by the SEA LIBERTY but were not acquired on radar by ARPA. At this time the SEA LIBERTY was not aware of a container ship (later identified as MV ARABIAN EXPRESS) approaching from East Keppel Fairway. This vessel was later identified as the ARABIAN EXPRESS. The navigation and accommodation lights of this vessel could be seen from the bridge of the SEA LIBERTY. The Master of the SEA LIBERTY asked VTIS to inform this vessel to allow the SEA LIBERTY to pass ahead of it. There was no apparent response from VTIS. The Master did not send any sound and visual signals to attract the attention of the ARABIAN EXPRESS. 

At 2315 the third officer on duty called the ARABIAN EXPRESS on the VHF. This call was not answered. Then, the Master of the SEA LIBERTY called VTIS at 2318. VTIS then called the ARABIAN EXPRESS. Again, there was no response from the ARABIAN EXPRESS to this call. At 2322 the Master of the SEA LIBERTY called the ARABIAN EXPRESS again requesting it to stop her engine and let the SEA LIBERTY pass ahead of her. 

At 2340 the third officer on duty phoned second officer and helmsman to come up for next watch (from 0000 to 0400). At 2341, the Master of the SEA LIBERTY again called the ARABIAN EXPRESS by VHF and repeated his request. The SEA LIBERTY was then advised by the ARABIAN EXPRESS that her engine had been stopped. The Master did not hear any sound signal and did not see any visual signal from the ARABIAN EXPRESS. 

At 2345 the Master of the SEA LIBERTY realised the risk of an imminent collision with the ARABIAN EXPRESS and ordered hard to port on the helm. 

At 2348 the ARABIAN EXPRESS collided with the SEA LIBERTY on the SEA LIBERTY’s starboard quarter in way of lifeboat and engine room. The angle impact between the SEA LIBERTY and the ARABIAN EXPRESS was 80 degrees. The engineers present in engine room felt the impact of the collision and immediately observed seawater rushing into engine room from the lower platform. 

At 2351 the main engine stalled due to the ingress of seawater in the engine room. After the collision the Master of the SEA LIBERTY informed VTIS of the collision with the ARABIAN EXPRESS. In addition, the Master, taking into consideration that as there were other vessels coming from the opposite direction, asked the chief officer and bosun to go to the anchoring station to prepare to let go the starboard anchor. At 2352 the vessel let go the starboard anchor and then port anchor. The Master rang the general alarm. “Not under command” lights were switched on. At 2354, the generator stalled and there was a blackout onboard the SEA LIBERTY. The emergency lights running on the vessel’s batteries came into action immediately. 

At 2358 the port side lifeboat was lowered to embarkation deck level. At 0030 most of the crew abandoned the SEA LIBERTY by the lifeboat and the remaining were rescued by Coast Guard Boat of Singapore. The crew remained in the vicinity of the SEA LIBERTY. A salvage tug “DEA CHAMPION” arrived on site. A LOF was signed by the owners of the SEA LIBERTY. At 0230 the Master and seven crew of the SEA LIBERTY re-boarded the vessel after observing the vessel to be in a stable condition. 

As a result of the collision a certain amount of lube oil in the engine room escaped to the sea through the damaged side of the SEA LIBERTY. This was immediately collected by the salvers.

In particular, the deck crew were to carry out chipping operations on the mast houses No2 and No3. The Bosun informed the deck crew of the work to be carried out and made sure that they were given the appropriate tools.
The Bosun then made his way to the mast house to help out with the work in hand. At the time, it had been stated that the Bosum was wearing safety equipment. At 0820 the Bosun slipped and hit his head in way of the mast house No2, port side. The Bosun injured his head with the fall.
The crew immediately administered first aid on the injured Bosun. Due to the seriousness of his injury, the vessel was re-routed towards Cyprus. The vessel contacted RCC Larnaca and a rescue helicopter was sent out to airlift the injured Bosun. At 1520 the Bosun was then airlifted to Cyprus where he received medical attention before eventually being repatriated.

The weather was good with wind SW 10m/s sea 2-3. The vessel was not rolling or pitching. 

Three able seaman and two cadets were assigned the task of carrying the storm ladder from the aft part of the vessel to the forecastle. As the ladder is of large dimensions it could not be carried along the deck. The seaman decided to carry the ladder on to the forecastle.

At this time, at 1450 in position 590 48.3’ N, 240 41.4’ E a cadet fell overboard. 

One of the cadets saw the other cadet falling into the sea from the top of the hatch cover. He immediately raised the alarm and ran to the after part of the vessel to notify the bridge.

The second officer who was on duty on the bridge at the time changed the steering to hand steering and turned the rudder hard to starboard. He gave out the “man overboard” alarm. 

The vessel’s course at the time was on 2480 speed 9.6 knots and when the vessel came to 1480 the engine was put to dead slow ahead and the vessel’s speed was 7 knots.

The person who fell into the sea was seen from the vessel while the vessel was executing the turn, however by the time the vessel was on course 1480 he was not sighted again. 

At 1456 the main engine was stopped. At 1500 the vessel’s course was 0780 and the speed was 3 knots.

A PAN PAN message was broadcasted by VHF and the Helsinki Search and Rescue centre responded to the call and directed two vessels that were in the vicinity to help in the search.

These were the passenger vessels “ROMANTIKA” and the “TALLINN EXPRESS 2”. 

The MV UFA, lowered one of the lifeboats manned by the Chief officer, the second engineer and a motorman to search for the missing man. The launch “MERICAR” of the Finnish Authorities joined in the search. 

Later on at about 1520 two helicopters joined the search. 

At 1635 the two passengers vessels were released by the Helsinki Search and Rescue centre and resumed their passages.

By 1655 both helicopters returned to land for refuelling and the search was continued by MV UFA, the lifeboat and the Finnish launch.

Some time around 1830, the chief officer who was on board the lifeboat was suffering from health problems. 

The second officer replaced him and the search continued.

At 1930, the Finnish launch came alongside the MV UFA and two officers boarded the vessel and took the necessary documentation and left the vessel.

As the swell was increasing and the lifeboat could not be recovered, the Master instructed the second officer to sail the boat in the leeway of the vessel to the port of Tallinn, were the vessel had to go to take on bunkers and stores.

The vessel arrived at Tallinn roads at 0045 and anchored.

At 0140 the lifeboat was recovered.

The person who fell overboard was not recovered and is presumed lost.

The damages to the propeller did not hamper ship's crossing to Tallinn and she was directed to the repairyard there.","[Primary Annex 1 not designated]","[Primary Annex 1 not designated]","[Primary Annex 1 not designated]","[Primary Annex 1 not designated]","[Primary Annex 1 not designated]","[Primary Annex 1 not designated]","[Primary Annex 1 not designated]","[Primary Annex 1 not designated]","[Primary Annex 1 not designated]","","","","","","","",""

The vessel left Heroeya at 0950 on 30 August bound for Norrkoping, Sweden. The weather during the voyage was partly cloudy with slight northwesterly wind. 

At around midnight the bridge watch was changed. The bridge team consisted of an officer on watch and a lookout. At 0430 on 31 August, the officer on watch sent the lookout for a routine fire inspection of the vessel. The vessel at the time was proceeding on course 162°T with a speed of 11 knots.

Between 0445 and 0518, the officer on watch fell asleep while on watch. There was no other person on the bridge at this time. During this time, the vessel passed a specified waypoint and the officer of the watch failed to alter course to 130°T as indicated on the passage plan. 

When the officer on watch regained consciousness, he found the vessel close to the shoreline. He immediately stopped the engine and ordered full astern on the telegraph. However, at 0520 the WILSON LEITH ran aground in the position 56°05.234 N   012°31.279 E. The Master immediately came onto the bridge and ordered to stop the engine. As the crew began taking soundings it became apparent that tank 2 centre and double bottom 3 starboard had been damaged. Slight water ingress was noticed inside these tanks. 

A salvage contract was signed. 1500 mt of cargo was lightered off onto a barge and the vessel was then-refloated at 2345 on 02 September. The vessel then proceeded to Landskrona, Sweden for discharging her cargo and repairs.

On 30 July 2003, when the vessel was in Aegean Sea the weather deteriorated to Gale Force 8 and at this time the vessel suffered damage to the main engine’s turbocharger casing.

The vessel took refuge at the port of Aliaga, near Izmir.

A shore repair company and the classification society surveyor attended the ship. As repairs to the turbo charger casing could not be carried out at this port, it was decided to blank off the turbo charger and sail with reduced power.

In the meantime a new turbo charger was ordered from the makers in Holland.

The vessel sailed from the port of Aliaga on 7 August 2003. In this reduced power condition the vessel was making about 8 knots.

After about 4 hours, the weather again deteriorated to Force 7 to 8. This lasted for the next two days.

On 9 August 2003 at 0510, the second engineer, who was on watch in the engine room, went down to the lower engine room flat to start the lubricating oil separator.

At this level were also the main generators of the vessel. The second engineer heard abnormal noises coming from the main generator set No 1 and went near the generator to investigate.

He could see water pouring into the engine room from the direction of the shipside and landing on the alternator, which by now was already emitting heavy smoke.

The second engineer sent the oiler who was in the engine room with him at the time to call the chief engineer who was in his cabin.

The second engineer went into the engine control room and noticed that heavy smoke was coming out of the main electrical switchboard. At this time, the second engineer went up to a higher level in the engine room where the chief engineer, who was coming down into the engine room, met him. 

The chief engineer tried to go down to the lower level of the engine room and noticed that the cables of the generator No 1 were already on fire and the water was spraying onto generator set No 2. The chief engineer went into the engine control room to stop the generator No 1 but heavy smoke had already filled the control room. 

The chief engineer went up to the crew’s mess room and telephoned the bridge. He requested the chief officer who was on the bridge to stop the main engine from the bridge by activating the main engine emergency stop.

The chief engineer also requested permission from the master to activate the engine room’s CO2 flooding system. The master gave the chief engineer permission to flood the engine room with CO2 after ensuring that all personnel were out of the engine room.

All quick closing fuel valves, all engine room apertures and ventilation ducts were closed and the CO2 was released.

After some time the chief engineer donned the fireman’s outfit and a breathing apparatus set and re-entered the engine room hoping to start No 3 generator, and consequently to start pumping out the water from the engine room.

The water level in the engine room by now was already up to the control room and the main engine was already totally submerged. The chief engineer went out of the engine room and reported to the master that all the generators were submerged and that water was coming in and flooding the engine room.

As the vessel was trimming fast by the stern, the master gave instructions to lower the port and starboard lifeboats and to launch the two life rafts on the starboard side.

As the vessel was low by the stern and listing to starboard, the starboard lifeboat and the life rafts were brought over to the port side.

The master instructed the second officer to send the distress signal.

All the crew were mustered on the port side boat deck and the master ordered the crew to abandon the vessel. The master accompanied by the chief engineer remained for another 15 minutes on board and later on, they too joined the other crewmembers in the lifeboat. 

The EPIRB and the SART equipment were activated.

About 15 minutes later, the vessel sunk.

A Polish tanker that had answered the distress signal eventually rescued the crew about one and a half hour later.

A Greek Coast Guard vessel arrived near the Polish tanker about two hours later and took on board the crew of the MV OGAN and took them to the port of Pylos, Greece.

There were no injuries to the crew due to this casualty.

En route, the vessel transited the Suez Canal, and took on bunkers at Port Suez.
On 25 July 2003, the vessel was on a course of 072° T and making a speed of 12.7 knots. The weather at that time was strong South Westerly Wind of Force 7 to 8, the sea was rough, with a south westerly swell of 3 m to 5 m. 

At 1545 the chief engineer observed a fire above the insulation of the main engine collector (exhaust) on starboard side. The fire was quickly spreading to the port side and No. 1 alternator had also caught fire. The Chief engineer told the third engineer (who was on duty at the time) to shut off the engine room blowers. The Chief engineer reported to the deck officer on watch advising him that a fire had broken out in the engine room. The officer of the watch immediately raised the fire alarm and informed the Master.

The motorman and the engine cadet, who were on the lower platform desk, noticed the fire and started to fight the fire with CO2 fire extinguishers. This was however unsuccessful. The fire was seen to be spreading quickly and soon afterwards No1 alternator tripped and the main engine stopped. The emergency generator was then started. 

At 15.48 all the crew mustered at their emergency stations. The “Not under command” signal hoisted and NUC lights switched on.

At 1551, after checking that all the crew were accounted for, the chief officer ordered the evacuation of the engine room. After the evacuation of the engine room, and consultation with the Master, the engine room was sealed off in preparation for releasing the fixed CO2  installation into the engine room.

By 1558, the engine room was sealed off and the Master ordered the activation of the fixed CO2  installation into the engine room. The emergency fire pump was also started and 3 fire hoses applied to cool the engine room boundary bulkhead. Sixty cylinders from the CO2  were activated at 1602. At 1615 an additional nine CO2 bottles were released into the engine room. 

At 1730, the forward engine room bulkhead was inspected from the inside of No.4 hold. The cargo in the No. 4 hold was observed to be in a good condition. Then at 1950 all the companionways, mess rooms, alleyways were checked and found satisfactory.

At 2200, the engine room entrance on the poop deck level was opened. The temperature at the entrance, inside the engine room was 600 Celcius. The Chief engineer and a motorman, wearing fireman’s outfits and SCBA units, entered the engine room from the poop deck at 2209. With them they took a thermometer, a CO2 fire extinguisher and an oxygen analyser. The atmosphere in the engine room was very hot and the two crewmembers left the engine room. Due to the amount of smoke in the engine room it could not be ascertained if the fire had been extinguished. Three further attempts were made to enter the engine room, and although thee remained a lot of smoke, no presence of fire was detected.

During this time, a fire patrol was maintained all around the engine room and in the accommodation. The fire hoses were continuously supplying boundary cooling to the engine room bulkhead.

On 26 July, the fire had been deemed to be extinguished and the crew commenced opening the engine room flaps and ventilator dampers for natural ventilation.

At 2015, No 2 generator was started and the engine crew started to clean the engine room.

On 27 July, the main engine was made ready for starting. At 1815, the main engines were blown through with air. By 1819 the vessel started to move ahead with dead slow ahead. The main engine revolutions were then increased slowly and a course set for Mumbai, India. The vessel arrived at Mumbai on 30 July.

The vessel arrived at Flisingen pilot station on 20 July 2003 at 2337. At this time a pilot came on board. 

At 0158 the vessel was abeam buoy No 75 G.

At 0212 when the vessel was abeam buoy No 75 G, the vessel started to turn slowly to port and the pilot instructed the helmsman to apply 300 starboard rudder.

The vessel still continued to turn slowly to port. The Master, suspecting that the steering gear was not functioning properly, switched the steering gear to emergency steering position and applied 300 of starboard rudder. At this time, the rudder indicator on the bridge was showing 300 to starboard, however the vessel was still turning to port.

Also at this time, the pilot contacted an outbound vessel that was approaching the MV PELICAN I and advised of the situation and the danger of a collision. 

The Master of the MV PELICAN I stopped the main engine and ordered full astern. Subsequently, he telephoned the Chief engineer in the engine room and advised him of the risk of collision and ordered all the engine room crew to come up from the engine room immediately. 

At 0213 the outbound vessel, which was the MV MAERSK BAHRAIN, collided with the MV PELICAN I. 

The MV PELICAN I was hit on the starboard side near the bulkhead between hold No 5 and the engine room. The engine room started to flood and a blackout occurred. The emergency generator came on automatically for a short time but was later switched off because of the dangers of short circuits due to water ingress in the engine room. 

Hold No 5 also started to take in water and the Master ordered the sounding of the affected areas to try and assess the extent of the damage.

When the vessel started to list to starboard, the Master ordered all the crew to suspend operations and muster on the wheelhouse port wing. 

After the managers were advised of the incident a tugboat was sent to assist the crew to abandon the vessel, as there was a danger of the vessel capsizing.

All the crew except the Master abandoned the vessel. Later on, the Chief officer was requested by the Master to re-board the vessel and assist. The MV PELICAN I was pushed by tugboats onto the riverbanks to stop her from sinking or capsizing.

Later on, the vessel was salvaged and taken to a floating dock where the hull was repaired.

The weather was clear and the visibility was good. Nothing indicates that the collision was caused by technical defects in the navigational- or steering systems on board the two vessels.
At the collision, the bow of GDYNIA hit FU SHAN HAI - at an angle of 110 -120 degrees between the two vessels - on the port side with the consequence that FU SHAN HAI sustained a comprehensive leakage.

After the collision, FU SHAN HAI stayed afloat but the bow kept sinking as the hours went by. After the collision, the master realised that the ship was in danger of sinking and transmitted a MAYDAY distress alert. The majority of the crew abandoned the vessel on port side lifeboat, while the master stayed on the bridge. Shortly after 13.30 hours LT, the master and the rest of the crew abandoned the vessel in the starboard side lifeboat.

The crewmembers were picked up and sailed to Bornholm by the rescue vessel from Roenne, the pilot boat from Allinge and a Swedish rescue vessel, which all had arrived after the collision. The master, the chief officer and an engineer were transferred to the inspection vessel HAVØRNEN so that they could assist at the subsequent work.

At 20.49 hours LT the same evening, FU SHAN HAI sank.

GDYNIA was damaged in the bow at the collision, but the ship was able to sail to a shipbuilding yard in Gdynia.

In the meantime fishing ship ‘Toscano” was on course 100° and speed 9.3 knots bound to Piombino.

Auto-pilot was on both for Sidersirio and Toscano.
At 21:30 hours personnel on watch on board of Sidersirio saw the fishing ship at a distance of about 10 miles.
At 22:30 hours Toscano was maintaining his course and it was at distance of about 3 nm, when the auto-pilot of Sidersirio was turned off and several calls without reply were done on VHF.
When the two ships were at about 3 cables distance the master of Sidersirio ordered the wheel hard starboard. The ship started turning on starboard side but it was too late to avoid collision.
Toscano’s crews declared that they hadn’t see the Sidersirio at all, neither on sight nor on the
radar screen. 
As a result of the collision the fishing ship foundered but no people were injured and no pollution 
was caused

A pilot boarded the vessel at 2140. Two tugs made fast, one forward and the other one aft. By 2215 hrs, the vessel was off its berth and with the vessel on dead slow ahead, the tugs let go at 22.38 hrs.
At 22.39 hrs, the vessel, being on the port edge of the channel, set its speed to full ahead and the rudder was set to hard to starboard. However at 2240 hrs, the P&O NEDLLOYD KILINDINI ran aground on the port side of the channel. The vessel’s course at the time of the grounding was 173.5 degrees. When grounded, the P&O NEDLLOYD was observed to have a 2 degrees list to port. All tanks and bilges were sounded at this time however no water ingress was noted.
Three tugs then proceeded to the vessel and made fast by 22.48 hrs. The tugs then tried to pull/re-float the P&O NEDLLOYD, however without success. The tugs later left the vessel.
After an underwater examination of the hull, the decision was made to pump out ballast from the forepeak, deep tanks and No.1 wing tanks. However, further efforts to re-float the vessel failed due to the low tide.
At 1915 hrs tugboats were made fast to the vessel in order to attempt to re-float the vessel. At 1920 hrs, the vessel was shifted from the shoal and re-floated was pulled into the centre of the channel. After an underwater further examination, no damages were noted to have been sustained by the vessel.

The vessel departed from Iskenderum on 3 February 2003 loaded with 8200 mt of bulk chrome ore.
On 5 February 2003 during the sea passage the vessel was maintaining a course of 270 while making 9 knots. The sea conditions were rough with south westerly wind of force 7/8. The vessel was rolling considerably – it was reported up to 20. At 1300 the main engine shut down without warning.
The vessel started drifting. After one hour’s work by the engineering team onboard the MV FLIPPER, it was identified that damage had been sustained to cylinder No2 of the main engine. However, the chief engineer was hopeful that this could be repaired within a few hours. The repair efforts proved unfruitful and the damage sustained was later identified as being more substantial that was originally thought.
The vessel’s drift continued at a rate of 2 knots in the SSW direction towards the shore. The wind and the sea were lashing against the starboard side of the vessel. The master then decided to inform the vessel’s managers about the situation onboard. Due to the possibility of the vessel drifting too close to the shore, both of the vessel’s anchors were prepared and the starboard was lowered to 2 shackles in the water. The vessel increased her rolling up to 35 and the weather conditions had increased to force 8/9.
At 1900, when the vessel was only 2 cables from the coast the port anchor was let go with six shackles in the water. The starboard anchor was paid out to eight shackles in the water. By the time the vessel’s drift had been stopped, the vessel was only 50 mm from the shore.
Because of the strong gale and heavy seas with wave heights up to 8 – 9 m, the MV FLIPPER started to pitch heavily. Noticing the possibility of the vessel being dragged onto the rocks the master contacted the DPA and requested tug assistance.
A tug arrived on site on 08 February 2003 and proceed to tow the MV FLIPPER to the port of Palamutbuku, Turkey as a refuge. The tug continued to tow the vessel to a repair port once the weather conditions improved.
