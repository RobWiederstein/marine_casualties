Loaded with 30,884 tonnes of fuel oil Erika sailed from Dunkirk to Livorno Italy on 8 December 1999.  On 11 December, while crossing the Bay of Biscay, she encountered rough seas and a west/south-westerly force 9 gale.  The Master attempted to correct a progressive starboard list and transmitted a distress alert.

When checking cargo and ballast tank ullages, the previously empty no. 2 segregated ballast tank was found to be more or less equal to sea level and two thirds full of water and fuel oil, but less than the level in the adjacent no. 3 centre cargo oil tank.  Cracks and buckling were noticed on deck in way of no. 2 starboard segregated ballast tank. The Master decided to head for the nearest port of refuge.

The list was corrected.  The distress alert changed to a safety message which was later cancelled.  During the night the starboard list reoccurred, and attempts to correct it were unsuccessful.  Meanwhile the cracks on deck widened.

On 12 December large quantities of oil were observed escaping to the sea.  Later part of the shell plate of no. 2 segregated ballast tank was seen to have torn away.  A second distress alert was transmitted.  As some of the crew were evacuated by a French naval helicopter the vessel broke in two.  Because the helicopter winch broke down, the crew remaining were evacuated by the port lifeboat and a second French naval helicopter.

COASTAL STATE REPORT

On 11 December 1999, the tanker Erika, laden with 30,884 tons of heavy (no. 2) fuel oil, was sailing from Dunkirk to Livorno, Italy.  While crossing the Bay of Biscay in foul weather, the tanker suffered a structural failure.  After a significant list was corrected, the hull broke in two crosswise some 30 nautical miles south of Pointe de Penmarcโh, Brittany.  The two halves of the vessel then sank in about 120 metres despite attempts to tow the stern portion offshore.

The whole crew of the Erika was safely evacuated by the National Navy under the co-ordination of the Atlantic regional search and rescue operations centre (CROSS - Centre Regional Opรฉrationnel de Surveillance et de Sauvetage) at รtel.  Following the shipwreck, a large part of the vesselโs cargo and bunker oil spilled into the sea.  This oil spill, abetted by difficult weather conditions, affected several hundred kilometres of coastline from the tip of Brittany to รle de Rรฉ.

At 14h44, while undertaking a course alteration to starboard, the vessel ran aground near the eastern end of รle d'Orlรฉans.  A refloating attempt the next evening succeeded in freeing the vessel, but only briefly, and the vessel grounded a second time near the initial grounding position.   The ALCOR sustained major hull damage near midships due to bending forces incurred during successive low-tide cycles.
The damaged hull was temporarily repaired and roughly half of the cargo was discharged onto smaller vessels.  On December 5th, the ALCOR was refloated and conducted to the port of Quรฉbec.  It was declared a constructive total loss.","Bulk Dry (general, ore) Carrier","Ship rendered unfit to proceed","16136","","","cement clinker in bulk","25","","","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","2007-07-30","2008-07-01"

The TROPICALE was completing a four day cruise originating and concluding in Tampa, with ports of call in Key West, Florida and Cozumel, Mexico.  The fire resulted in no deaths or injuries to passengers or crew and there was no pollution.  However, both of the vessel's engines were disabled.  Concurrently, the tropical storm ""harvey"" was approaching with high seas and winds up to 50mph.  The crew was able to restart the starboard engine and the TROPICALE began moving at 9-10mph in a southwesterly direction, away from ""Harvey"".  When ""Harvey"" veered south, the TROPICALE altered course back towards Tampa.  Unfortunately continuing engine trouble and rough seas forced TROPICALE to abort her efforts to reach Tampa and she finally berthed at Port Manatee, 30 miles south of Tampa.  She arrived on September 22, 1999, two days behind schedule.","Passenger Ship","Ship rendered unfit to proceed","35190","Lloyd's Register (LR)","6654","","605","1096","","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","2007-08-10","2008-07-01"
