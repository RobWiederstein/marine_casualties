The ship was scheduled to berth on 25 November 1995. 
The 38,305 tonne deadweight bulk carrier New Noble anchored about four miles off Newcastle, at 09:55 hours on 22 November, about 1.2 miles south of the Goonzaran. New Noble was also to load coal and was due to berth about midday on 24 November. 
At 15:00 hours New Noble collided with Goonzaran in way of number three hold and then passed down Goonzaran’s side making two further contacts. 

Goonzaran suffered significant damage to the hull and deck plating. New Noble suffered relatively minor damage to the bow at the forecastle head level and an indentation in its bulbous bow. Nobody was hurt as a result of the collision. 
On 24 November, both ships were brought into port for inspection and necessary repair.

At 06:00 hours on 23 February, Bobby was located 136 nautical miles to the north of Dampier and, as a safety precaution, ships lying at anchor in Dampier Roads were instructed to weigh anchor and proceed to sea. 
The Maltese flag, 61,297 deadweight tonnes bulk carrier Bulkazores, one of six ships at anchor, was the first ships to clear the anchorage. The Master took the ship two miles beyond port limits and then hove-to, to ride out the developing storm. 
At 07:22 hours on 24 February, the Master of Bulkazores advised Dampier Port Control that Bulkazores was being set towards the shore and, at 10:26 hours, the ship took the ground close to Kendrew Island. 
Bulkazores refloated at 16:33 hours, at high water, and the Master, on advice from the Harbour Master, let go the starboard anchor. Bulkazores then safely rode out the remainder of the storm. After inspection by divers, the ship was moved on 28 February, to a position close to Dampier public wharf. 
An inspection by divers indicated extensive scratching and paint removal, but only relatively minor indentations in the bottom plating. On 2 March, after an internal inspection confirmed that no tanks had been ruptured, the Classification Society declared Bulkazores fit to load cargo.

The ship was on a ballast voyage from Jeddah, in Saudi Arabia, to Napier, New Zealand, where it was to load a cargo of sheep for the Middle East. 
On the morning of 9 September 1995, Mawashi Al Gasseem was at No.1 berth, Outer Harbour, Adelaide, with the auxiliary boiler in use supplying steam for the auxiliary services. The oiler on watch had joined the ship, for the first time, the previous evening. Shortly after coming on watch, he began to encounter problems maintaining steam pressure and water level in the boiler. At about 09:20 hours, when he was asked to supply steam to the deck machinery, he called for the assistance of the Fourth Engineer, who, when he saw the low water level in the boiler, immediately shut off the fuel to the burner. 
Five or ten minutes later, the Fourth Engineer saw what he believed was still a fire in the furnace, but was, most probably, the boiler internals glowing white hot. He shut off all the valves in the fuel system, but the fire appeared to continue burning and the boiler casing around the aft end of the side water-wall began to glow red hot and give off smoke. 
The ship’s staff used a number of foam and CO2 extinguishers in an attempt to cool the casing. Hoses were then rigged and used to cool the casing more effectively. At 09:50 hours, the fire brigade was called and arrived at 09:57 hours, by which time the apparent fire in the furnace seemed to burn itself out and the furnace was cooling down. The fire brigade took over from the ship’s staff and continued for the next hour to cool down the boiler casing. 
After some inspection doors in the casing had been removed, a cursory inspection of the boiler gave the impression that, apart from some distorted tubes, it had suffered no damage. However, when the Chief Engineer went into the furnace that evening, he found that the boiler had been severely and extensively damaged. The side water-wall and refractory had collapsed, the rear water-wall was burned out and most of the screen tubes were burned out. Most of the furnace tubes in way of the radiant heat from the burner showed signs of having reached white heat and had begun to melt.

On board were the Master and one deckhand. 
On its deck, the barge was carrying a cargo of materials and equipment to enable it to be put on to a low-loader at Wyndham and transported overland to Lake Argyle. There it was contracted for thirteen weeks, to move equipment and stores during work on the Ord River hydro electric scheme. 
The voyage plan was for the vessel to hug the coast, from Darwin to a position near Port Keats where, if necessary, it would anchor and wait for suitable weather conditions before making the crossing of the south-eastern corner of the Joseph Bonaparte Gulf at the mouth of the Victoria River. Strong south-easterly winds were forecast. 
At about 04:00 hours on 7 August, the ship was south of Cape Hay when the Master handed the watch over to the deckhand instructing him to follow a course approximately one mile off the coast. The Master then turned in for a few hours sleep. 
At some time before 07:00 hours, the Master was awakened by the motion of the ship and found that it was in rough seas and approximately six miles off the coast, west of Pearce Point. The wind was blowing from the south-east at 25-30 knots and an estimated 3.5 m sea was running. He decided to run with the weather for a while, but after a further twenty minutes turned on to a reciprocal course and headed back into the weather towards the lee of the coastline. 
The ship made no headway into the weather. After a while, the deckhand went down the engine room hatch, situated on the main deck, to carry out engine checks. He had been gone for about five minutes when the barge suddenly developed a loll. The Master left the wheelhouse and when he reached the deck, the barge appeared to be sinking by the stern. A few seconds later it rolled to port and capsized, settling in a stable, upside down, attitude. Both men were thrown into the water. 
The Master twice managed to swim to the exhausted deckhand, who drifted away from the ship, and twice dragged him back to the upturned barge. After several unsuccessful attempts to get the apparently lifeless deckhand up the sloping bow door, the Master, exhausted, let go of him and the deckhand drifted away. 
By that afternoon, the owner of the barge, having not been able to make either radio or satellite phone contact with the ship, flew his own aircraft down the ship's intended route but did not find the barge. On the morning of 8 August, when Keppel Trader still had not arrived at Wyndham and there had been no communication with the ship, the owner advised the Marine Branch of the Northern Territory Department of Transport and Works, which contacted the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre and a search and rescue (SAR) operation was initiated. 
The Master was rescued late that afternoon by an army helicopter, after spending some 34 hours on the upturned hull and in the water. 
Two weeks later Keppel Trader was towed back to Darwin having been salvaged and righted.

The ship had been engaged on this service since 1988 and habitually followed a route inside the Great Barrier Reef between Townsville and Cairns, and then by the Grafton Passage, through the Coral Sea to the Fly River. 
At about 04:00 hours on 24 June, the ship failed to make a course alteration off Brook Islands and maintained a straight course to run aground south of Murdering Point, Queensland at about 06:00 hours. 
Immediate attempts to refloat the ship were unsuccessful as the tide started to fall. The ship was towed off the ground by the tug Otto Tasman at about 18:30 hours on 24 June. The Svendborg Guardian  was subsequently towed to Cairns for inspection. 
No significant damage was found and the ship resumed its voyage to Kiunga on the afternoon of 26 June.

At 01:00 hours on 29 March, the ship embarked a licensed pilot off Cairns for the passage through the inner route to Goods Island. The ship made good a speed of marginally over 15 knots. 
At about 02:30 hours on 30 March, the Pilot left the bridge in an area where there was to be no alteration of course for about two hours and where other shipping and fishing boats presented no potential hazard. The Pilot gave clear directions to the Second Mate, the officer of the watch, that he was to be called at a position that he had marked on the chart, or if the mate had any concerns. 
At a little after 0400, the Mate relieved the Second Mate, who passed on the instruction about calling the Pilot. 
At 04:58 hours on 30 March, Carola ran aground on South Ledge Reef. 
The Master, who was asleep in his cabin, was woken by the change in the characteristic vibration of the ship. He went to the bridge where he found only the Mate and lookout. The Pilot was called from his cabin. 
The damage was assessed, soundings of the ship's tanks were taken and the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre was informed. It was established that the fore peak tank was breached and some water was entering the bow thruster space. However, the ship's pumps were able to handle the ingress of water. 
No injury was sustained to the Pilot or any crew member and no pollution resulted from the grounding. 
The Carola refloated about six hours later at 11:15 hours on the high tide and, after the Master established that it was safe to do so, the ship continued its passage to Goods Island. It anchored off Goods Island after 15:30 hours. In the evening of 30 March 1995, a surveyor from the ship's classification society boarded the ship and over the next three days the ship was inspected by divers and repairs carried out, to allow it to continue the voyage to Singapore. 
Carola resumed its voyage on 4 April 1995.

The ship is taking enormous amounts of water on deck and hatches. At 04:20 hours, the main engine stopped for about 20 minutes, thus the ship’s list increased to 20 degrees. Attempts are made to pump out the water without success. No water in tanks or hold was determined. The main engine started again and the master started to turn to starboard and ship heeled over to 70 degrees list and directly after went to 90 degrees and started to go down. The master got hit by the loose coming gyrocompass and passes out. The mate was forced to leave him on the bridge. The sound of explosion was heard from the engine room as ship was sinking. 2 engineers never came up from the engine.

A liferaft with 4 crew members was found at about 23:00 hours on the same day by the ship Epsilongas, no distress signals had been sent from the Arawak. The Columbian and Panamanian coastguards took part of the rescue actions and two more persons were found alive, 2 were found dead. 3 persons have most probably gone down with the ship to a depth of approximately 3000 m.

The resulting spray of hot heavy fuel oil at about 6 bar pressure ignited on the engine's exhaust manifold and then spread burning oil over the deckhead above the engine. The fire intensified and expanded rapidly. 
Most of the engineering department personnel were working around the engine room at the time. The First Engineer ran to the engine control room and shut down the generator before attacking the fire with an extinguisher. The extinguisher, however, failed to discharge. The motorman had grabbed another extinguisher but that, too, failed to discharge. By the time other extinguishers had been brought to the scene and used, the fire had increased to the point where the Chief Engineer decided to evacuate the engine room. 
The engine room was evacuated, the vent flaps were closed and the ship's fixed fire- fighting system (Halon) was discharged. When it became apparent to the ship's crew, who were making their way to their muster stations on deck, that it was a serious fire, a number of them ran to the port lifeboat. 
Ten to fifteen minutes after discharging the Halon, a crew member, wearing breathing apparatus, made a re-entry and reported that some small patches of fire remained. These were put out by two other crew members with portable extinguishers. 
The First Engineer, wearing breathing apparatus made an entry and started one of the diesel generators, restoring power to the ship which had remained blacked out since No.3 generator had been stopped. The emergency generator had started but failed to come on line. 
The engine room was ventilated and the damage was assessed. Initially it appeared that the damage was superficial, but closer inspection of the main cable run above No.3 generator revealed that it had suffered some damage.

During the evening of 23rd January, operations commenced on recovering the Glomar Robert F Bauer's anchors, preparatory to a move to a new drilling location, Altair No.1, in the Medusa field, 54 nautical miles (100 km) west of Barrow Island. 
Glomar Robert F Bauer uses an anchor buoy system, the anchor recovery operation requiring each anchor buoy to be taken on board one of the supply ships and the anchor hauled from the sea bed using the buoy pennant wire. 
On the morning of 24th January, while the three-man deck party of Far Sword was positioning an anchor buoy for securing on the aft deck, a wave broke over the stern and swept them onto the deck. One of the seamen needed to be transferred to the Karratha hospital, where it was confirmed that he had a number of fractured ribs and a punctured right lung.
