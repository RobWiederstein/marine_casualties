While the forward station was passing their remaining two head lines, the Messenger line of the Mother Vessel got fouled in her anchor flukes. The Chief Officer lowered the anchor to the water level in order to clear the lines but this was taking too long ( about 20mins from the time of ""first line""). Considering the delay, the mooring Master advised the daughter vessel to pass her spring lines to the Mother vessel. While the operation was in progress, a sudden tension on the stern lines lead to the parting of 2 lines. Two Crew Members were seriously injured.

(the “Company”), was outbound from Punta Pereira, Uruguay on the Rio de La Plata. 

On the morning of 17 March 2020, in preparation for disembarking the Pilot, the Chief Officer (C/O) tasked the Bosun with adjusting the height of the pilot ladder. Due to DELICATA‘s freeboard at the time, a combination arrangement of the accommodation and pilot ladders had already been prepared. The Bosun assigned an Ordinary Seafarer (OS) to assist him with this task.  

The two crewmembers attempted to pull up the pilot ladder but were unable to do so as it was tied to an attachment point on the ship’s hull. The Bosun then descended the accommodation ladder, without wearing a lifejacket and safety harness, to untie the pilot ladder. Shortly thereafter, the OS heard the Bosun shout and looked over the side to see that he had fallen into the water. The OS immediately notified the crew over VHF and then went aft to the Accommodation to call the Bridge.

DELICATA and other nearby ships conducted a search for the Bosun. He was spotted by another outbound ship and was recovered by the pilot boat. When recovered, it was determined that he was deceased.

Initial information provided by MRO XI stated that MV “DON CEFERINO ALFREDO”, owned and operated by Gothong Southern Shipping Lines, Inc. (GSSLI), was moored and in the process of unloading her container cargoes when O/S xxx accidentally slipped from the Hatch Cover/Pontoon No. 2 and fell down at the port side passage main deck

Immediately, the onboard medical team provided first aid assistance to the severely injured crew member. Subsequently, the Master informed the Officer-In-Charge, Davao Terminal Operation Division of GSSLI, which in turn requested the assistance of Davao 911

On or about 17:32 Hrs, the ambulance arrived at the scene and brought O/S xxx to the Metro Davao Medical and Research Center, Inc. (MDMRCI) accompanied by the 2nd Officer. All efforts were undertaken to revive and administer emergency medical assistance to the concerned crew

At around 18:22 Hrs of 02 March 2020, O/S Del Pilar was declared dead on arrival by Dr. Grace Stephanie Luna, attending Physician/Resident on Duty of MDMRCI

Based on the Clinical Summary Report of O/S xxx, the following was determined:

1) Left upper extremity has multiple closed fractures;
2) Right lower extremity has multiple closed fractures;
3) Right groin area has multiple femoral laceration, opening up to the subcutaneous area; and
4) Left Inguinal area has laceration exposing the internal iliac

The official cause of death was shock secondary to severe hemorrhagic shock.3 Initially it was reported that the concerned crew member accidentally slipped and fell down at the port side passage main deck while assisting on the removal of the pontoon hatch covers at Bay No. 23, 21, 19 and 25. However, circumstances suggest that the right leg of O/S Del Pilar had been snag between the pile of pontoon hatch
covers and the gantry crane post. Thereafter, O/S Del Pilar was seen by the Able Bodied Seaman assign at the quay area sitting at the hatch coaming before falling down at the port side passage main deck;

By way of background, MV “DON CEFERINO ALFREDO” departed Cebu Port last 00:15 Hrs of 29 February 2020 with 296 TEUs4 of container cargoes and was manned by a crew complement of 24 members. On or about 18:00 Hrs  of 01 March 2020, MV “DON CEFERINO ALFREDO” arrived at the outer berth of KTC Container Compound and started to offload her top deck container cargoes at around 09:42 Hrs of 02 March 2020

Upon the completion of the investigation, it was divulged that O/S xxx was standing at the port side hatch coaming and was walking towards the gantry crane. According to the gantry crane operator, prior to the occurrence, O/S xxx signaled him that he was intending to hitch a ride on the gantry crane moving towards the forward section of the vessel wherein the closed pontoon hatch covers at Bay No. 15, 13 and 11 were located

When the gantry crane had advanced forward, the right leg of O/S xxx got caught at the gantry post, severely injuring him. It was further deduced that O/S xxx was already severely injured when he fell from the port side hatch coaming. This is substantiated by the medical findings reflected in the Medical Summary Report of MDMRCI

During the ocular inspection, it was observed that there was only a distance of 0.2794 meter between the gantry crane post and stockpile of pontoon hatch covers. Slipping through the passage between the gantry crane post and the said pile was very difficult for the O/S. It was further observed that there is a blind spot on the area where the gantry crane operator is located when a crew member is situated at the port side of the vessel. Consequently, the distance between the hatch coaming and main deck passage way was only nine (9) feet or 2.7432 meters, which could not possibly facilitate a fatal fall to the seafarer unless a head injury/trauma was incurred from the accident. Based on the medicals findings, no head injury or internal head trauma was incurred by O/S xxx. Further, it was determined that working aloft the hatch coaming was strictly prohibited and presented a risk as per the company’s safety management system procedures
