The Master was on the forecastle, directly controlling the operation. Before the mooring hawsers could be released from the ship, the import hose drifted under the hawsers and he ordered the main engine to be run astern for about 1 minute in an attempt to pull the hose clear. At about 19:54 hours, after the wire suspending the oil import hose parted suddenly, the mater ordered the crew to finish letting go the hawser pickup lines so that the ship could depart the mooring buoy.

An integrated rating applied the port winch drum’s brake to stop the drum moving and then stepped between the cheeks of the drum to cut the lashing that held the end of the heavy hawser pick line on the drum. 
At about 19:58 hours, when the lashing parted, the last three turns of heavy line rapidly unwound from the drum, striking the rating on the head and throwing him under the winch drum. He died as result of his injuries.

The explosion took place in the ship's steering gear compartment, where the deckhand was carrying out painting work. As a preparatory measure, he cleaned the surfaces with a degreasing agent. The resulting vapour led to the formation of an explosive gas-air mixture. The automatic start-up of the diesel heater in the same area ignited the mixture. The deckhand was severely injured by the explosion and had to be treated in a specialist clinic. The ship was only marginally damaged by the explosion and small fire that followed.

The next port of call was Oslo, Norway. The ship's command and an apprentice were on the bridge, both citizens of the Netherlands. The Freya was exempt from the obligation to accept a pilot. Navigation was on the basis of the nautical chart was not in operation. The ship was operated in the autopilot mode. The two radar systems were operated in North up, relative mode.
The weather conditions were good. The wind blew from the south at 3 Bft and it was cloudy, but there was no rainfall. As the Freya reached the Elbe approach at 22:00 hours, there was an Ebb stream of about 2 Kts. The voyage speed of Freya was 18 Kts over ground.

As the Freya passed the light buoy 24 at the location of Gelbsand, preparations were made for the next course alteration to port. At t this moment a lighted cardinal buoy had been spotted for the first time on the portside ahead. The buoy was one of two south-cardinal buoys that secured a construction area for building the Gelbsand leading light outside the fairway at the location of the light buoy 22. A restricted area had been set up around the construction area. Freya's command did not see any indication of the construction area on the nautical chart, because the corresponding official chart correction was not yet available on board.

Freya was called by the Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) Cuxhaven using VHF and was requested to execute a ""hard to port"" manoeuvre. At the conning position on the bridge, a switchover to manual control was then made, the rate of speed reduced and a ""hard to port"" executed. Meanwhile, the VTS lade further calls. At 22:16 hours, the Freya collided with the front light structure. The cargo ship was severely damaged. Water entered the forepeak. Nevertheless the ship was able to anchor in the Neuwerk roads without needing any support.

Nobody was injured and no substances hazardous to the environment were released due to this marine accident

On 12 December 2008, the ship reached the Brunsbütel lock. At 09:24 hours, the eastward canal passage began as a Traffic Group (VG) 3 ship with pilot advice.

Due to a collective call at 09:19 hours as well as the AIS data which had been received, the ship's command was aware that the OOCL Finland and the Haldoz were approaching on the section between the inland port and the Kudensee siding area. On reaching the Ostermoor ferry, visibility reportedly dropped to 200 m. Therefore the speed was reduced to about 7 kts. Immediately after passing the Ostermoor ferry, visibility reportedly deteriorated to 100m. The oncoming OOCL Finland was passed safely off the port boundary and then shortly afterwards also the Haldoz.
The ship's command then reportedly noticed that the RMS Saimaa turned to port and accordingly her stern neared to the southern embankment. The initiated rudder and engine manoeuvres prevented contact with the canal embankments. Finally, the RMS Saimaa was positioned at an angle to about 20° approximately 15 m away from the northern embankment with virtually no speed through water. The bow was reportedly positioned well north of the canal axis.

The Nordic Diana was sailing from Halla (Finland) to Newport (United Kingdom). She passed westward through the Kiel Canal (NOK) on 12 December 2008 as a VG 3 with pilot advice. 
The Kudensee siding area was passed at 09:34 hours. Visibility had reportedly   been fluctuating sporadically, but reportedly dropped to about 100 m at canal kilometre (ckm) 7.0.
At about 09:46 hours, the pilot on the RMS Saimaa called the pilot on the Nordic Diana by VHF. He was situated under the Brunshbüttel viaduct and requested that both ships pass port-by-port. The RMS Saimaa was reportedly not identifiable on the radar of the Nordic Diana.  The pilot on the Nordic Diana complied with the requested pass. Following that, he reportedly advised the chief officer, who was at the helm, to steer to starboard further still in order to provide the RMS Saimaa with as much room as possible. At that point, the speed of the ship was reportedly not reduced as they were concerns that the steer ability may then be lost.
When the RMS Saimaa became visible on the Nordic Diana's radar unit after passing under the viaduct, the pilot reportedly realised that the agreed port-by-port pass was not possible. Despite all countermeasures, the collision was unavoidable. 
Due to the collision, The Nordic Diana moved towards the southern embankment. However, an astern manoeuvre and appropriate rudder manoeuvre enabled the ship to be positioned lengthways on the canal again. 
The two ships were subsequently inspected for damage. There were no injuries. Water ingress was detected in the forepeak and in the bow thruster room on board the RMS Saimaa. The bow thruster was reportedly no longer operable. The Master gave orders for the areas to be pumped out. The RMS Saimaa remained afloat and was manoeuvrable. 
After consultation with the VTS, the two ships sailed to Brunsbüttel under their own steam

On final approaches to the berth the bow encountered an area of decreased under keel clearance, which resulted in the port quarter of the vessel swinging to port. This was further aggravated by the effect of the left hand propeller as the vessel was operating astern propulsion. 
Despite rapid actions by the master and pilot to put the rudder hard to port and kick the engines ahead, the port quarter came into contact with an unfendered concrete knuckle at the end of the berth. This resulted in the vessel sustaining an indentation and small fracture to the shell  plating.

The Co2 was released.  Instead of the 21 bottles being released, all the 34 bottles in the bank were released.  Fire was extinguished successfully.

The cause of alternator failure was a failed non drive end bearing on the alternator of one generator set (No. 6).  Smoke was seen coming out of the generator space 15 minutes before the fire alarm sounded.  Although the watch keeping engineer was in the engine control room which was 10 m away from the generator room he did not recognise that an alternator had failed catastrophically; tripped off the main switch board causing the thrusters to power off; broke the turbochargers foundation and ruptured lubricating oil pipes spraying oil onto the by now exposed alternator causing the fire to break out.  The engine continued to run and by the time he had diagnosed the situation, the engineer on watch could not enter the room to activate the emergency stop.  Eventually the engine was stopped from the emergency generator room.  The generator engines on this vessel had a history of similar failures and the makers have been unable to pinpoint the cause of the problem.

The officer was climbing down the pilot ladder when the painter connecting Princess Rose to the warship parted. As the passenger ship drifted away from transfer position, the lower rungs of the ladder became trapped in the boarding access. Consequently, the bottom of the ladder was pulled away from the warship's side to an angle of about 40° until its lower spreader gave way under the increasing tension.

While shooting the lines through the aft hatchway from inside the shelter deck, the two end-of-line dhan buoys and a heavy marker buoy had been prepared to be launched into the sea by two deckhands from the open deck above. A 15m line was connected between the marker buoy and the dhan buoys. The dhan buoys were also attached to one end of a 300m riser line, which passed through the hatchway and was stowed in a shelter deck bin.
When the fishing line had been shot, the vessel was stopped so that three heavy weights, which were attached to the other end of the 300m riser, could be launched into the sea. The vessel then moved forward again allowing the riser line to pass through the hatchway. When the riser line was nearly all out, one of the deckhands threw the dhan buoys over the side, and, as the connecting rope paid out, the second deckhand released the marker buoy. Suddenly, the second deckhand was lifted up and thrown over the metre-high bulwark. The first deckhand shouted to the shelter deck crew, who saw the first deckhand land in the water on his back. He made no attempt to swim to the buoys and he was quickly lost from sight. The marker buoy was then picked up to see if the deckhand had become entangled in the line - he was not. The skipper broadcast a PANPAN message on VHF channel 16, which was received by a nearby fishing vessel.  He also attempted to send a Digital Selective Calling alert on medium frequency, the latter which was not received by the local coastguard station. However, the coastguard was later informed and a large search ensued but the deckhand was not found.

The gas cutting assemblies were not leak tested and the ""in use"" gas bottles were co-located with the remaining bottles increasing the risk of fire spread.           
Neither accident was reported to the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) nor to the management company's Designated Person Ashore (DPA).
Recommendations have been made to A.P. Møller Maersk which include a review of internal and external communication procedures, control of contractors, hot work arrangements and accident reporting procedures.  The company has also been recommended to issue instructions on securing of mooring equipment for sea and preserving voyage data recorder information for accident investigation purposes.
The repair contractor has been recommended to ensure that no flammable material is left near gas bottles, its workers are equipped with Very High Frequency (VHF) radios, a safety watchman is always available, that gas connection leak tests are carried out and, where feasible, ""in use"" bottles are separated from those in the  storage area.

SAXO caught the trawl of ANNA PAULSEN, which then was drawn towards SAXO before the trawl wire broke. The aft part of ANNA PAULSEN was damaged, but the vessel could return to port by its own means. There was no damage to SAXO.

Both vessels failed to maintain a proper look-out, which in SAXO led to a wrong decision on the passage situation and a non-observance of the fact that ANNA PAULSEN was engaged in fishing, why SAXO was the give-way vessel. In ANNA PAULSEN the sole skipper did not see SAXO before the collision, whereby he lost the possibility to take such action as would best aid to avoid the collision.

The vessel’s master took action to improve the mooring pattern forward  - the end of the vessel taking the  greatest impact of the North Westerly wind – but at approximately 14:15 ship’s time (UTC + 1) an exceptionally large gust peaking to 50 knots, accompanied by a shift of wind direction to the North, caused an increase of pitching and rolling movements of the vessel and parting of moorings forward.  All of the forward moorings parted with the exception of two lines, one of them a breast line on a drum, and  the other a spring line on bitts that was not contributing to lateral restraint. Although the remaining lines did not part they were unable to hold the vessel alongside. 
1.2	As the vessel’s bow swung away from the berth the gangway fell from the quayside and a passenger and AB on the gangway were projected into the seas below.  A second passenger who was close to the end of the gangway also fell into the sea.
1.3	Two other passengers on shore were struck by parting rope tails but sustained only minor injuries.  There was potential for very serious injury that was fortunately avoided. 
1.4	With three persons in the water the vessel’s staff responded by throwing life rings to the casualties in the water and preparing to launch the Man-overboard (rescue) Boat.  The life rings served to keep casualties afloat until assistance arrived in the form of a harbour boat, which was fast enough to suspend the launching of the vessel’s own boat.  Further life rings were thrown by shore staff from the pier.  One of the casualties – an elderly female – was unconscious.  She was kept afloat by the AB.
1.5	The passengers were rescued first and attended to by paramedics ashore before being taken to hospital.  The AB was rescued subsequently and after medical checks returned to work on board the vessel.  The passengers struck by lines were attended to by ship’s medical staff.  All have since made a full recovery.
1.6	After the casualties were removed from the water the vessel was manoeuvred alongside with the assistance of tugs, and by using her own thrusters forward.  
1.7	The vessel sailed from Bilbao at 17:54 on 29th October for Honfleur in France after which her next port of call was Dover in the UK, where this preliminary enquiry was carried out on 1st November 2008.

The weather forecast on sailing was for strong winds (F6-7) with wave heights predicted to be about 3.5 metres.  The off-going master advised the on-coming master that the conditions were fairly rough, but not unusual, and he had experienced 3.5 metre waves during his last crossing.

On sailing the weather conditions were as forecasted but about half way through the crossing the conditions deteriorated.  The wind was 45 knots (F9) from the south-west, the sea had become rough with up to 5 metre waves, and there was a heavy southerly swell running.  The master reduced speed to 10 knots but soon after, at approximately 14.40 hours LT, a series of large wave crashed onto the hulls which caused obvious damage, but the vessel made its way safely into port.  

Investigations found that the composite hull panels and the reinforcing GRP overlay panels had twisted, causing cracking and failure of the panels and of the internal stainless steel wire bonding and tensioning arrangements.  The damaged area was not part of the hull structure but was the cosmetic fairing of the forward part of the hulls.

The local MCA Marine Office surveyed the damage and agreed a temporary repair plan until the next docking in Jan 09.  A new operating limit of use in maximum 3.5 metre seas was also imposed until full repairs were undertaken.

There were no personal injuries to either the 380 passengers or 35 crew.

At the time of the accident one of two contractors were burning off damaged sections of the hoppers using the ship's oxy-acetylene burning equipment.  The four oxygen and acetylene cylinders were stowed in separate cabinets on the upper deck.  The equipment was supposedly fitted with non-return valves at the inlet to the blowpipe and flame arresters at the discharge from the regulating valves in accordance with normal practice.

At about 13.45 hours LT the nozzle of the blowpipe became partially blocked by burnt metal particles.  Instead of shutting off the gas and using the correct cleaning tool, the burner opted to ""blow through"" the system using the oxygen supply.  Soon after, a loud ""pop"" was heard and black smoke was seen to come from the acetylene gas cupboard.  The fire was reported to the bridge and three fire hoses were rigged distant from the cabinet.  About 10 minutes later the smoke appeared to have reduced.  At 14.01 hours LT the chief engineer assessed that the fire had come from an acetylene hose and considered it safe to shut off the bottle valve.  However, as he cautiously opened the cabinet doors, flames were still seen in the cabinet.  The chief engineer retreated and the fire hoses were directed onto the burning acetylene hose.  At 14.05 hours LT the local coastguard were alerted from transmissions to VTS of the incident.  It was presumed that, because there was not a bottle explosion, the flame arrestor had worked and that the flame was external to the bottle.  It was on this basis that the chief engineer approached the bottle once again, and under cover of the fire hoses he managed to close the acetylene bottle valve and extinguish the fire.  
The coastguard was immediately advised and they put the master in contact with the local Fire and Rescue Service Liaison Officer who was content that no further action was needed.  The vessel then made its way towards its next port.  

Subsequent advice from the company's Safety Officer instructed the vessel to go to anchor as soon as possible and he also advised that the incorrect safety information had been given.  The master was informed that acetylene bottles may self heat if they have been subjected to flame impingement and that the risk remained for 24 hours.  The vessel went to anchor and water was sprayed over the acetylene bottles for a further 24 hours.

Investigation found that the MRCC watch manager contacted the local Fire and Rescue Service instead of contacting the Maritime Incident Response Group (MIRG) Liaison Officer who would have provided the correct advice via the local Fire and Rescue Service in that the bottles should be cooled and an exclusion area established.  It further transpired that the person providing the advice was not an operational fire fighting officer.

It was also possible that the heated bottle could have exhibited vibration set up by the ship's movement which could have led to an explosion and in this case ship evacuation would have been recommended.  It is worth noting that if the incident had happened ashore, a 200 metre exclusion zone would have been established lasting for 24 hours.

Further investigation by the ship safety officer identified that although the non-return valves and hoses had been subjected to annual inspection by a competent person there was little guidance on how to test the flame arrestors.

The ""popping!"" sound heard just before the fire is typical of ""backfire"" when the flame ignites the gasses inside the blowpipe when the torch is held too close to the work piece.  In this case it is likely that the flame travelled past the non-return valve and was stopped at the arrester fitted just before the regulator valves.  It is likely that the hose that failed had been damaged in some way causing it to fail and the flame to be established.

An independent report on the burning equipment was undertaken by BOC.  Their report identified that the nozzle had become over heated as a result of a partial blockage.  This resulted in the acetylene mixing with the oxygen supply in the torch mixing chamber when it was re-opened.  Because the non-return valves were not fitted the flame travelled up to the flame arrester where it was prevented from travelling into the acetylene bottle.  The flame front pressure can typically reach 75 bar and as the hose is pressure tested to 65 bar it is capable of bursting the hose, as in this case, releasing the gas to feed the fire.

At about 17:30 hours on the previous day, the ship put to sea from Hong Kong and sailed for Ningbo following  instruction to shipping form the local port authority because of the approaching Typhoon ""Hagupit"". At about 19:45 hours, immediately after reaching the open sea, the Chicago Express encountered heavy winds and swell from a south-easterly direction, this exposed the ship to rolling motions of up to approximately 32 degrees. The ship's command therefore decided to deviate from the intended general north-easterly course towards Ningbo and weather the storm, which at the time of the accident had reached a wind force of 10 with gusts of up to 12 Bft, by steering variable courses against the direction of the wind and swell. This led to the roll angle being reduced to values of about 20 degrees. 
At about 02:45 hours, the ship, which at the time was  under the control of the Master and steered by  the Helmsman manually, was suddenly hit by a particularly violent wave coming from starboard  just as she rolled to starboard. Following that, the Chicago Express keeled over several times, at which the inclinometer registered an (uncorrected) maximum roll angle of 44 degrees for an estimated period of 10 seconds. Due to the enormous accelerative forces on the bridge, the Master, the Helmsman and the Lookout (AB) also present lost their footing and were thrown across the bridge. The officer on watch, who was the only person on the bridge able to hold on to the chart table, hurried to the helm and stabilised the quickly and after a short period of orientation, he and the officer on watch found both the Master and the AB lying unconscious on the floor with bleeding wounds. While the Master regained partial consciousness shortly after, in spite of immediately initiated first aid measures carried out with the assistance of other summoned crew members and guided by medical consultations via radio (Medico Cuxhaven), they were unable to save the unconscious AB. At 04:17 hours, resuscitative measures were discontinued.

At the same time as the rescue operations on board, the ship's command established contact with MRCC Bremen and MRCC Hong Kong and organised the evacuation of the severely injured Master. At about 07:53 hours, after the weather had calmed, a rescue helicopter from Hong Kong, China  by MRCC Hong Kong, China reached the ship, took the Master on board and transported him to a hospital in Hong Kong. The Chicago Express subsequently also returned to Hong Kong, China to hand over the body of the AB and facilitate the investigation of the accident by the coastal state. The Chicago Express left the port of Hong Kong, China for the final time on 26 September 2008 at 14:00 hours.

During the ensuing weeks, the Master, who was in acute danger of losing his life for an extended period because of the severity of his internal injuries, initially received medical care in Hong Kong, China and was flown to Germany after his fitness to travel was restored.

On board the Polaris, numerous damages of the forecastle area, to the bulwark on the port side and to the superstructure at the stern were identified. As a result of contact with the bank, the steering gear no longer worked correctly. As the ship continued on its voyage, it had become apparent that the rudder actually laid midships when the rudder position indicator indicated between 15° and 25°.

MM sustained damage to its port side hull above water level. A cut of about 1 metre long, penetrated her shell plating and holed just below her deck line, near its midship section. 

The collision occurred when MM was maneuvering to pick up pilot for berthing at Tanjung Pelapas Maersk’s container berth. The incident position being Latitude 01° 14.00’ Longitude 103° 30.5’E, outside Tanjung Pelapas Port limit, about 1.3 nautical miles from the pilot station.  At the time of the collision, the weather was fine with good visibility, low swell and sea.

There was no injury or fatality on the NS. Neither was there report of injury or fatality from the MM.

NS sustained minor damage to its forecastle deck (see Annex A47 – NK Class damage report certification). Its forward bulwark, collapsed inwards. It bulbous bow also sustained indentation, but not holed. Her seaworthiness was not affected and temporary repairs were carried out in Singapore. After the temporary repair, NS proceeded to Taiwan, China and discharged her cargoes of jet fuel before returning to Singapore for dry docking and permanent repairs. 

There was no pollution resulting from the collision.  

The investigation highlighted the main contributory factor to this incident as poor application of BRM on the MM resulting in failure to keep clear of other vessel.

The investigation identifies the following safety issues:

•	Based on VTIS information, the execution of bridge resource management on board the MM was inadequate because single person errors, such as the loss of situational awareness and decision making went unchecked.

•	Inadequate bridge procedures or inadequate passage plan, with respect to identifying the set and drift and monitoring and managing traffic around itself in critical and confined water maneuvers.

•	The failure to respond to radio communication thus not making all available measures to reduce the risk of collision in good time.

Il est accompagné d’un autre remorqueur, le SD Loire, appartenant à la même société.
A 04:17 heures, alors que le SD Gironde se trouve sur l'avant du Dublin Express, remorque passée et élongée (le SD Gironde se trouvant à l'arrière remorque capelée), l'alarme pression basse air de contrôle moteur principal se déclenche sur chacun des deux moteurs, suivie à 04:18 heures d'un débrayage des deux propulseurs.
Prévenu par le capitaine du SD Gironde de la perte de propulseur du remorqueur, le pilote du Dublin Express demande SD Loire de le ralentir.

Malgré la décision du capitaine de laisser filer la remorque et l'intervention rapide du chef mécanicien pour rétablir la propulsion, le remorqueur ayant perdu la maîtrise de sa manœuvre est heurté par l'étrave du porte-conteneurs une première fois contre son bordé tribord, puis une seconde contre ses superstructures.

Le choc en déformant la coque, provoque la rupture des vannes du réfrigérant eau douce du moteur tribord et l'arrêt des deux moteurs de propulsion par manque de réfrigération. 
 A 05:50 heures, grâce à l'assistance d'un autre remorqueur, le RT Pionner, dépêché sur le lieux par la SNRH, le SD Gironde est pris en remorque et amarré au quai Johannès Couvert.

Quant au Dublin Express, il termine sa manœuvre de présentation  et d'accostage au quai de l'Atlantique avec l'assistance des remorqueurs SD Loire et RT Stéphanie.
Il n'y a pas de blessé ni de pollution. L'abordage qui n'a occasionné que des dégâts matériels principalement au remorqueur, aurait pu avoir des conséquences beaucoup plus importantes. Celui-ci a dû rentrer en cale sèche pour réparation et n'a pu reprendre son service que le 25 Septembre 2008

The master was using a joystick to control two Schilling Vectwin rudders, which were routinely used to produce astern thrust rather than placing the engine astern. During the turn the master realised that the port rudder had responded to astern thrust, but the starboard rudder was still positioned ahead, causing the ship to steer towards a rock shelf. The master ordered the thruster unit into astern but this action did not stop the movement towards the rocks. The master ordered both anchors to be dropped, however, at 08.10 hours LT the bulbous bow struck the shelf.

The fire took place, during the process of finishing the repair works, the reflection and cleaning equipments, to the external side of Cargo tank No.3 and concrete insulation of the tank. The material of the cargo tank insulation is polysterene, which is self-ignited, slow burning and is protected externally by a galvanize 0.5 mm thick sheet.

The reaction of the crew was to try and extinguish the fire, by using the fire and safety abilities, which were on standby, was immediate but without success, so they called the assistance of the national Greek Fire Services Department. They came as fast as they could and they fought with the fire, which was extremely difficult to be extinguished.

The fire was extinguished by the fire services at about 20:50.

The ship’s chief mate, from the Philippines, and one worker from the repair contractor, were immediately found and recovered dead.

Six more workers from the above mentioned contractor were missing, and finally found dead after completion of pumping out works.

The ship’s master remained onboard supervising water pumping out works and ship’s safety in general, as the ship was listed to starboard side, due to flooding.

The water pumping out works were finally completed, as well as locating the missing people.

A representative from the company and a P & I Club representative attended onboard, in order to provide any assistance to the crew etc.

La M/N Chilena “Tacora”  es una nave Granelera,  construida el año 1985 en Japón, la cual por años ha sido operada en el transporte de hierro, utilizando el muelle mecanizado de la Compañía Minera del Pacífico, CMP., entre otros. 

Su Armador corresponde a una prestigiosa compañía chilena que opera habitualmente con varias naves para el transporte de hierro, desde los puertos de embarque en la III y IV regiones. La nave aún cuando tiene más de 20 años, está en buen estado de mantención.

Previo al siniestro, el “Tacora” había terminado el embarco de 24.976 toneladas métricas de graneles en el puerto de “Huasco” y los operadores habían considerado que se dirigiera a Coquimbo para embarcar 12.000 toneladas métricas de granza.

Dicha travesía comenzó a las 09:20 horas del día 26 de junio de 2008,  zarpando a las 05:30 horas, con destino al muelle mecanizado de Guayacán, navegación que se realizó sin inconvenientes y con buenas condiciones de mar y viento, arribando a los límites del puerto el mismo 27 a las 15:12 horas, momento en el cual la bahía presentaba brisa moderada del SW y 10 nudos. 

El buque considerablemente cargado, llegó al punto de embarco de práctico con la máquina muy despacio avante, a una velocidad de entre 5 y 6 nudos, sobrepasando en al menos 2 o 3 nudos la velocidad de seguridad fijada para aproximar al  puerto.
El práctico lo abordó por medio de una lancha que se abarloó con dificultad al “Tacora”, debido a la elevada velocidad que este llevaba en su aproximación. 

El práctico al llegar al puente paró la máquina y cayó para tomar  la enfilación de fondeo, pero al llegar al nuevo rumbo, el 112° y a pesar de estar ya la caña cerrada a la banda contraria para aguantar la caída, la nave continuó cayendo lentamente a babor, quedando en rumbo de colisión con el muelle y aproximadamente a 4 cables del mismo. 

El práctico indicó al capitán su decisión de dar atrás para parar la viada, el capitán discrepa e indica al práctico la conveniencia de dar paladas avante para botar la proa a estribor y salir de la demarcación de colisión con el muelle. 

Se ordenó a la máquina despacio avante, lo que efectivamente se materializó por un lapso estimado de medio minuto, sin embargo la nave siguió avanzando en rumbo de colisión al muelle, no cayó a estribor como se esperaba e incrementó levemente su velocidad de aproximación al muelle.

El práctico decidió abortar el atraque y no fondear el ancla por considerarlo peligroso debido a la velocidad con que aproximan, ordenando al remolcador Ultramar XI cambiar de banda para carnerear por la amura de babor, a fin de botar la proa hacia estribor. Conjuntamente ordenó “parar la máquina” y después dar “atrás media fuerza”. 

El capitán segundos más tarde ordenará “toda fuerza atrás” y posteriormente “repetido atrás”. 
Dado el poco tiempo de maniobra disponible, el remolcador no alcanza a actuar eficazmente y la nave finalmente colisiona de proa con el extremo Norte del muelle mecanizado CMP, lo que provoca daños en la nave y en la estructura portuaria.

Producto del accidente, no se registraron lesiones a personas, ni contaminación al medio ambiente marino y los daños se circunscribieron a  rotura y abolladuras del casco, en el sector superior del bulbo y a la altura del void space, comprometiendo la integridad de estanques de lastre, al quedar estos abiertos por la proa,  posibilitando el embarque de  agua de mar. 

La estabilidad de la nave no fue afectada, sin embargo en consideración al tipo de daños en el casco, debió ser sometida a reparaciones de fortuna, a la gira en la bahía y posteriormente con apoyo de astillero las definitivas en Talcahuano. 

El Muelle sufrió daños estructurales, pero pudo continuar operando con restricciones.

The bow thruster was running in the ""Thrust 2"" setting when the vessel suffered a blackout when about 150 metres from the dockside.  The vessel was stopped using its main engines and a spring which was connected to the dockside.

Investigations found that the bow thruster motor had overheated and the generator supply breaker had tripped out on overcurrent causing the blackout.  Further investigations revealed that the bow thruster motor had recently been overhauled and the slip rings at the ""Thrust two"" position had been incorrectly secured resulting in one of the electrical phases being lost.  This meant that the motor was single phasing causing excess current to be drawn.  The over current and timing settings on the bow thruster supply breaker were set at about 600 amps and 20 seconds as approved by Lloyds.  This meant that the lower amperage and timing of the generator supply breaker acted first tripping the breaker and causing the blackout
It is noted that the bow thruster motors are made by the Dutch Company - Becker and have caused trouble for some time.  The operating company ahave adjusted breaker settings in accordance with advice from Lloyds, in addition the resistor banks had been operating very close to their maximum rating.  An alternative, higher rating resistor bank, has been approved by Class and was fitted during dry docking week commencing 6 October.

When the two ships approached each other, the Raba called the Arthur Becker on the VHF; they tried to reach an agreement for manoeuvring, but in doing so a misunderstanding resulted. The two ships collided bow to bow at approximately 06:45 hours, and as a result the Arthur Becher then hit the Raba with her port side. Both ships received material damage above the water line.

Nobody was injured and no pollutants escaped. The wind was coming from NW with a strength of 4 Bft. Wisibility was good and good and the torches of the oil fields lit up the environment.
Norfolk Express was running at a speed of 21 kn along the southern edge of the traffic separation scheme and according to the voyage planning should have carried out course changes at 04:35 and 04:51 hours in the direction of traffic. At the handling over of the watch at 04:00 hours, the traffic situation had been explained and also that two course changes and overtaking manoeuvres were to be expected in the immediate future. Another ship on the same course had been ahead at a distance of 2 nm. A second ship was ahead at a distance of 4 nm. No further close approaches could be seen and traffic appeared to be running smoothly. As a consequence the Officer on watch decided to dismiss the lookout to carry out cleaning works in the superstructures.

After this the Officer on watch proceeded to the radio station that is located starboard aft next to the chart table. There he read his emails on the computer and in between observed the radar display. His thoughts had been very occupied and later he could no longer remember exactly what happen up to the accident. The Vessel Traffic Service had suddenly called and drawn attention to the danger of stranding.
Thereupon he had proceeded to the radar set and ascertained that speed was being reduced. In his estimation it was now too late to alter course with strong rudder manoeuvres or to check the position on the chart. Intuitively he put the engine telegraph to stop. He then set the Norfolk Express gently aground.

At about 1429 on 19 May 2008, at the approximately position lat. 15-39.0’N, long. 110-44.6’E, a lifeboat accident happened onboard the Hong Kong registered container ship BLUE OCEAN while she was en-route from Hong Kong to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. 
2.  During a boat drill on the No. 2 Lifeboat at sea, the Third Officer who was accompanied by a seaman inside the lifeboat, pulled the remote control cable to lower the boat by the order of the Master. The lifeboat swung out from the lifeboat davit. 
3.  The Master ordered the Third Officer to lower the lifeboat further, but the cable was found jammed. The Third Officer asked the seaman to help him pull the cable together. Suddenly, the lifeboat descended rapidly and plunged into the water, rebounded, swung towards and hit the shipside and was damaged. Water rushed ran into the lifeboat and flushed the Third Officer to the sea. 
4.  The Master of BLUE OCEAN conducted a search and rescue operation for the Third Officer and the seaman. The seaman inside the No.2 Lifeboat was rescued but the Third Officer was still missing. The SAR operation for the missing Third Officer conducted by BLUE OCEAN alone continued until 1300 on 20 May 2008, but it was in vain. After that, the Master recovered the No.2 Lifeboat and resumed the voyage to Ho Chi Minh City.

The westerly wind came from starboard, more from astern than from abeam, with a strength of 3-4 Bft and ebb tide ran against the ship at 3 – 3.5 Kn. The mooring manoeuvres were controlled from the port bridge wing. In the wing were the Master, Second Officer, a Service-engineer and the Harbour Pilot. The mooring was carried out without any problem. During this, the helm and the engine controls, including the transverse thrusters, were operated by the Second Officer according to the recommendation of the Pilot. The Ruiloba should be moored with three bow lines and three stern lines respectively as well as two fore springs and two aft springs. After all the lines were fixed on land, Bremerhaven Port was notified that the Ruiloba had moored at 18:10 hours. Afterwards the Second Officer accompanied the Pilot to the aft deck. There the tugboat was still attached with a loose towline to starboard. On the starboard pilot ladder the Pilot noticed an unusual turning of the Ruiloba to port and so he went back to the bridge. There the Master reported that from the port wing no movement of the Ruiloba could be detected anymore. The ship however laid approximately 7 metres distance from the pier at the stern. The tugboat was instructed to push the stern of the ship back to the pier again. After this the Ruiloba was about 5-6 meters further south than its original position. Through the forward movement and the veering away of the stern, a stern line and one fore and one aft spring each were broken. Because of this, two seamen were gravely injured on the legs.","CONTAINER SHIP","Serious injuries","14018","","24496","","15","","","","","","2","","","2009-09-08",""

She was operating a line service between Helsinki/Finland and Travemünde. The intention was to moor up as usual, with the stern at pier 6 of the Skandinavinkai. The weather and visibility conditions were good, and there was a prevailing east-north-easterly wind with a force of around 3 Bft.

On the board the Finnlady were 175 passengers, 34 crew members and a Pilot. The Master, the Chief Officer and the Pilot were on the bridge. The Second Officer was standing by at stern for the mooring manoeuvre at the mooring station. The Chief Engineer and the Second Engineer were on duty in the engine control room.


Once she had put into the port, the Finnlady turned at around 19:45 hours inside the turning basin provided. At 19:46 hours, a control failure alarm for the starboard controllable pitch propeller (CPP) system was output both on the bridge and in the engine control room. This was not initially attributed on the bridge. The ferry then shortly afterwards headed at up to 4.8 kts across the stern port towards the bridge structure at pier 6, some 5.5 cable away. The master was navigating from the port-side bridge conning position. The actual pitch of the two propellers was ""Astern 2-3"" corresponding to a pitch of approximately 25%. As of 1949, when the Master set the telegraphs to zero pitch in order to hold the ship and then to ""Ahead"" the pitch display for the starboard propeller still remain on ""Astern"".  However, as the port-side propeller was set to an ""Ahead"" pitch, the stern of the ferry swung out to port. After a call to the engine control room, the ""Re-Connect"" button was pressed on the bridge.  The steering control was also switched back to the central conning position. At 19:52 hours, the starboard propeller could be controlled again. However, by that time, they were just a few metres between the stern and the pier, meaning that, a minute later, the Finnlady hit the pier loading bridge at a residual astern speed of 3.4 kts.


Despite the significant impact speed, nobody was injured. There was also no leakage of substances harmful to the environment.

Bilge pump was put to service to transfer this water to bilge holding tanks. Ballast pump was also started sea to sea to reduce ingress of water. Company management office was informed accordingly to carry out the necessary repairs. Company in return informed the engineer that the vessel's position about 16 nm from nearest platform of Bombay High oilfields, and so the vessel altered course to 207 (T) at vessel’s speed of 19 knots. 

At 13.30 hours LT the vessel was at a safe distance of 35 nm from nearest oil rig. Vessel engine was stopped and the arrangements to carry out repairs by fabricating blanks were carried out. The ship’s management committee of master, chief engineer, chief officer and second engineer discussed the work to be performed. 
At 14.00 hours LT the vessel's engine was stopped and repairs were commenced. All sea suction valves were closed and electric power was supplied from deck auxiliary engine. All valves on the ballast line were shut. Chief Engineer confirmed that there was no noticeable leakage hence the removal of leaking valve was carried out. 

At 17.00 hours LT while the blank was being fitted to replace the valve, water suddently started  gushing through the valve opening. The blank slipped out of place due to the excessive pressure of incoming water. Bilge pump was started to transfer water into bilge holding tank but there was no control over the ingress of water which rose at 1 cm every twenty minutes. 
The management office of the vessel was informed and their instructions were followed to close sea chest,  and shut overboard discharge valves. The main sea water pump was started sea to sea to confirm the sea chest valves were holding. 

At 19.40 hours LT the emergency bilge suction was also opened to build down the water level, but the water level remained almost constant. 
At 22.40 hours LT the Indian coast guard vessel “ Vijaya” was alongside with three submersible pumps for pumping out water from engine room.

Afterwards the yacht kept proceeding out to sea and there was a further near-collision with another yacht. Once at sea the visibility improved. After manoeuvre training, Intention IV was supposed to return to Warnemunde port. To do so the yacht had to re-enter the area of reduced visibility, where a close quarters situation occurred with another pleasure craft. Later the sails were taken down and the yacht proceeded under engine. In this part of the voyage too, the crew only used the technical equipment present in an inadequate manner.

Power was restored and the ship proceeded back to Picton where the passengers and freight were put ashore to allow the ship to return empty to Wellington to investigate the cause of the power failure.
Two diesel generators were supplying power to the ship when first one, then the other, tripped off the power distribution bus-bars.

At around noon on 19 April the crew finished the discharging and loading and was making ready for departure. This included the closing of the side-doors. During this operation the ordinary seaman (OS) fell down from the elevator and was injured.

The OS was closing the no. 2 side-door, the aft one. He was alone on this part of the tween-deck. During the closing operation the OS was standing on the cargo elevator, which was in a hoisted position. He tried to lower the elevator by using the remote control box, but nothing happened.

Then suddenly the elevator fell down, because it slipped from a position where it, some way or another, had been in a tight corner and because the wires were slack due to the OS’s attempt to lower the elevator.
When the wires tightened up the elevator stopped abruptly about 2m above the tweendeck, and the OS was thrown off the elevator and down on the deck.

The bosun, who saw the OS falling down, at once called other crew members and the captain. An ambulance was called for, and it arrived very soon after the accident and took the OS to the local hospital.

The OS had broken his right arm, had damaged his left heel and had several minor wounds at his head.

La restricción para Canal Pulluche era de 7,5 metros de calado en bajamar, por lo que la nave excedía en 50 centímetros el resguardo que recomendaba el derrotero. 
No obstante ello, el Capitán estuvo de acuerdo en realizar la navegación, utilizando para ello el Paso Recto, que se abre entre Bajo Roepke y la Punta del Bajo, el cual aún cuando presenta menos agua, requiere de un número menor de maniobras de caída para su cruce, que el otro paso disponible. El Oficial de Guardia, si bien estaba en el puente junto al Capitán, no se involucraba activamente en tareas de control de la navegación.
Franqueado el Bajo Roepke, la nave, que sólo controlaba su derrota por medio del índice paralelo del radar y representaba su posición por GPS sobre una carta náutica desplegada en un computador portátil con un sistema de registrador de track “Ozi Explorer”, se desvió de la ruta trazada, pasando cerca de un bajo marcado en la carta con una sonda de 9.8 metros, en cuyas inmediaciones tenía un bajo desconocido de 6,4 metros, en el cual tocó fondo sin quedar aprisionada.

The hatch cover lifting operation was then restarted after approximately ten minutes in the absence of the Chief Officer with the AB (senior) standing on the tween deck hatch cover that was being moved, the hatch cover was hoisted approximately one metre and then halted as the cover was visually checked for clearence, upon recommencing the lift the hoist wires and the lifting frame fell onto the AB causing fatal injuries.

3. Upon being alerted the Master requested an ambulance and proceeded to the cargo hold where a number of crewmembers had mustered to assist, paramedics arrived on the vessel within ten minutes of the accident with it being apparent that the AB had died as a result of the accident. The body of the deceased was moved ashore to a mortuary later that evening.

4. The vessel was subsequently diverted to Gibraltar and was attended on the 14 April 2008 for the purposes of undertaking an enquiry into the death of the seaman under Section 92 of the Gibraltar Merchant Shipping (Accident Reporting and Investigation) Regulations 2006 was also commenced.

The chief engineer operated the quick closing valves and the remote stops for the engine room fans and fuel pumps. The crew closed the dampers for the engine room fans and the funnel vents and rigged fire hoses to boundary to cool the engine room casing and the funnel. 

After about 50 minutes, the fire cut the electrical power supply to the emergency fire pump and water ceased to flow from the fire hoses. The master ordered the crew to close the engine room skylight and then muster. He then instructed the chief engineer to activate the ship’s fixed fire extinguishing system.

At 11.20 hours LT, the master reported the fire to the Australian Rescue Coordination Centre (RCC).

By 15.00 hours LT, the crew had determined that the fire was extinguished. The engine room was ventilated and the crew entered to assess the damage. They were able to re-start many of the engine room systems and restore electrical power but they could not re-start the main engine. The ship was by then about 90 miles south of Esperance, Western Australia and drifting towards the Archipelago of the Recherche.

The ship’s managers entered into an agreement to tow the ship to Fremantle and, on 1 April, the tug Wambiri departed from Fremantle, Western Australia. Three other tugs, two based in Esperance and one that was in the vicinity towing a barge, were tasked to assist the ship until Wambiri arrived. 

By 12.45 hours LT on 5 April, Wambiri had rendezvoused with MSC LUGANO and taken the ship in tow. At 15.06 hours LT on 13 April 2008 the disabled ship berthed in Fremantle.

Hope Bay drifted in an easterly direction, initially without anchor and subsequently at anchor. The multipurpose ship Mellum was in the vicinity of the disabled ship as of 11:50 hours. At about VTS Wilhelmshaven dispatched the ocean tug Oceanic to Hope Bay at standby tug

When the main engine was running again at 19:00 hours, Hope Bay intended to follow the ship operator's instruction and sail to Cuxhaven. For this the ship was guided by a radar pilot from Elbe Approach East Radar to the estuary of the river Elbe. The ship passed the Elbe buoy at 20:31 hours. Fourteen minutes later the engine failed again. A tow connection was thereupon to be established by Oceanic. As a result of the sea state during the subsequent manoeuvres, several persons on board the tug were injured. There was slight contact between the two ships, the heaving line parted during handing-over of the towing gear, and at 22:49 hours the disabled ship and the tug collided. The severity of the damage led to discontinuation of the assignment and to the tug proceeding to Cuxhaven.
Further drifting of Hope Bay was prevented by means of dropping two anchors. In the afternoon of 13 March 2008 Bugsier 3 was able to establish a line connection and take Hope Bay to Cuxhaven

The ship was under the conduct of a harbour pilot who had taken over the conduct from the master about five minutes before, after the master had manoeuvred the ship off the berth.

As the ship left the berth, it began to be set towards the bulk carrier Goliath berthed ahead. VAN GOGH  was under the influence of the ebb tide and fresh water that was flowing from the Mersey River’s catchment following heavy rain in the area in the previous 24 hours.

VAN GOGH was difficult to manoeuvre at low speed because of its twin propellers and single rudder configuration. This, combined with the strong ebb tide and fresh water outflow in the river at the time of departure, resulted in there being insufficient water flow over its rudder to enable the pilot to manoeuvre the ship as he intended. In addition, the master did not inform the pilot that the crew would be using the ship’s engines independently during turns in the river. This resulted in the pilot being concerned that his orders were being countermanded because he saw that the engine telegraph levers were not as he had ordered.

Following the grounding, the pilot successfully manoeuvred the ship back into the channel and the ship departed the port without further incident. There was no damage to the ship and no pollution resulted.","Passenger","Ship remains fit to proceed","15402","DNV AS (DNV)","2452","Passengers","226","414","","","","","","","","2008-11-07","2011-03-04"

Three sailors died in the machine room, where the fire broke out. 
The «Rio Blanco» was taking on a cargo of automobiles and farm equipment when the blaze began. The Brazilian Marine Authority  investigated the cause of the fire, which could have been caused by a leak in a fuel pipe inside the machine room. 
The preliminary investigations undertaken by Harbors Captaincy naval inspectors of Santos Port pointed out  that at approximately17.35 hours on 16th February,  during the receipt of oil,  damage occurred in one of the fuel system's intermediary valves located in the ship's machines room. During attempts to repair the valve a heavy oil leak occurred directly on the auxiliary motor discharge nº 1, which began the fire.
The crew could not contain the fire and the Fire Department's assistance was requested. Firefighters extinguished the flames shortly after dawn on February  17th.
In accordance with the Resolution A.849(20) Code for the Investigation of Marine Casualties and Incidents  devices, the Chilean Navy sent experts to the port city of Santos to begin a joint investigation of the accident with Brazil's Navy. Brazil took the role of lead investigating State.

Because of the fire, everything on the ship was sompletely switched off. The ship Rio Blanco was transferred by tugboats from Vehicles Export Terminal on March 2nd to the wharf in front of the warehouses 33 and 34, in Right Margin of Santos Port. 
Despite mechanical and electrical problems that prevent the vessel's propulsion, the cargo carrier buoyancy was not affected. The ship was unfit to proceed trip.

On 06.02.2008 several hours from arrival to the port of Trieste, the vessel had a fierce fire on board during her navigation in the waters of the North Adriatic Sea. The fire was noticed by the alarm of the automatic fire detection system at around 0535 (Turkish local time). A crew member was sent to the alarm scene and he noticed the fire on the trucks, which were parked inside the main deck. Accordingly, the general alarm was activated. Due to the alarm, the mustered crew attempted to fight the fire. However, due to the thick smoke and rapidly expanded flames, the crew failed to extinguish the fire. 

At 06:04 a Distress call was made from the vessel by VHF. The coastal stations immediately activated the rescue units upon receiving the Distress call.

The fire spread to all cargo spaces within a short time of 15-20 minutes. Firstly, it expanded at the aft side of the vessel. This situation blocked the passage to the life saving units for the crew who were mustered on the bridge and due to the risk of being trapped on the bridge all crew and passengers tried to escape to the fore part by sliding from the port wing using the ropes which were deployed at the bridge port wing side. During this action, 3 crew members and 2 passengers injured themselves by falling on to the top deck.

At the fore part, the crew waited for a while hoping the fire would not reach the forepart. However, due to the close flames, they disembarked the vessel by using the fore life raft.

Some of the crew entered into the life raft which was designed for 6 persons, the others waited in the sea around the liferaft. The passenger vessel IKARUS PALACE reached the scene and rescued the survivors at 08:06 and brought them to the port of Venice at noon. Fortunately, there were no casualties due to the good weather, sea condition and the immediate and comprehensive assistance of Croatian shore units.

The vessel burned for 2 days. Many tugs and fire extinguishing planes tried to extinguish the fire. They succeeded in extinguishing it on 08.02.2008 and cooling activities finished on 11.02.2008.

At the end of the fire the ship was totally burnt except for the ship’s engine room, pump room, steering gear, bowthruster room and emergency generator room, in other words all machinery spaces. All cargo, ro-ro decks, accomodation and cabins became unrecognizable. The top ro-ro deck melted and collapsed down, the ship’s whole structure became deformed due to the high temperature. The engine room remained intact  except the damage of the smoke and some minor melting of plastics due to heat. The ship survived sinking due to the high performance of the ship salvage team. There were no casualties due to the grace of God and the bunker/oil tanks remained intact so no pollution occured. On  20.02.2008, the ship was towed to the port of Trieste.

Due to the non-operational condition of the ship; the owner declared the constructive total loss of the ship from the insurers on 21.02.2008 and this request was approaved by the insurers on 25.03.2008.

Soon after leaving Belfast the main engine temperatures started to steadily increase.   The oil pressure dropped and it was noticed that there was an increase in the engine oil level.

Tests of the oil confirmed that it had become water contaminated.  The problem was located on a cylinder head and water was seen to transfer to the head valve operating gear into the sump.  The Chief Engineer advised the captain to come immediately to anchor, but the harbour authorities objected because of the frequent fast ferry service.  The vessel was taken further out from the harbour, but the engineer became increasingly concerned about the oil contamination and firmly advised the master to anchor or else risk the engine being written off.  By now the vessel was about 3.5 cables from a pipeline - the captain decided that it was safe to anchor.  After doing so the engineers removed the affected cylinder head and found blanking and locating screws loose.  The cylinder head had been subjected to the manufacturer's overhaul and had only been fitted 2 weeks previously.

While the repairs were being undertaken SOSREP was informed and decided that in light of the weather conditions and the potential risk to the pipeline,  the vessel should be towed into Belfast.  The vessel arrived alongside about 7 hours later.  Repairs were completed by the crew while alongside, and the oil change completed.","GENERAL CARGO","Ship rendered unfit to proceed","2260","Germanischer Lloyd (GL)","3418","Road salt","6","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","",""

The weather throughout the day had been strong Westerly gale force winds, increasing in strength. At the time of the initial incident winds force 10 were experienced along with large sea / swells.
Although the passage had been easy, with sea and swell coming from astern, as Riverdance approached the Lune Deep buoy she began to roll. Initially two trailers were reported to have shifted before the rolling died down. As the trailer shift was being investigated the rolling started again, stronger than before and resulting in cargo shifting from the trailers. A list of 45 deg to port was experienced and the master decided to bring the vessel head to wind. He applied full starboard wheel and the vessel turned rapidly, thus increasing the angle of heel. As the vessel became broadside to the wind this also added to the total heeling effect and a maximum list/heel of 60 deg was reported.
The vessel turned from a heading of 090 to 170 in 70 seconds. She then lost one of her two engines due to lube oil low pressure trip and would not come any closer to the wind. At this time the master contacted the Coast Guard.
Attempts to restart the engine were made and to transfer ballast to bring her upright. During this time Riverdance drifted towards the Shell Flat sands off the coast near Blackpool. Around 2300 hrs UTC she grounded on Shell Flat on a falling tide.
Initially 14 persons were evacuated by helicopter leaving 9 onboard attempting to stabilise the situation. Whilst aground the list decresed to about 25 deg. Ballast was transfered ready for coming off on the next rising tide in the morning. 
Once the vessel was starting to refloat the engines were put astern in an attempt to bring her into deeper water, the wind and seas were still storm force from the West and the engines had no effect. After about two hours, attempts to re float the vessel were stopped, Riverdance then came broadside to the weather and sufferred a sudden severe heeling over to starboard. The remaining crew were taken off the vessel and Riverdance was left aground with a heel of about 40 deg.

The skipper had served on board for about 1 year, but for many of the 15 crew this was their first trip in the vessel.  
At about 20.00 hours on 18 January the long-line was shot away.  The crew then rested in their cabins until they were called at 01.00 hours LT to recover it.  At about 06.30 hours LT on 19 January 2008 , thick black smoke was seen coming from one of the crew’s cabins, but the smoke detection system alarm had not sounded.  Some of the crew attempted to fight the fire but they were quickly beaten back as the thick, acrid smoke quickly spread through the accommodation area.  Although a number of watertight doors were left open near to the fire, containment was established.     Four of the crew suffered smoke inhalation.
The skipper asked a nearby Spanish fishing vessel to stand by in case they had to abandon the vessel. 
The main fire pump could not be started because the electrical control circuits had been destroyed.  The emergency manual fire pump was defective, so there was no pressurised water supply with which to fight the fire.  As the paint on the main deck started to blister, the skipper attempted to starve the fire of oxygen, but he was hampered by faulty ventilation isolating valves, and had to stuff rags around the ventilation terminals.  The rags were later removed, and the fire re-ignited. At 12.31 hours LT the skipper finally alerted the Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centre (MRCC) at Madrid, 6 hours after the fire had started.  Emergency service support was quickly provided.  The Irish Naval vessel, LE Eithne, arrived on the scene and transferred a fire party, who extinguished the fires.  SHARK was then escorted into Killibegs for inspection.
The fire caused extensive damage throughout the accommodation area.  The investigation found numerous examples of private electrical equipment connected to the cabin supplies, and electrical cables were found to be chafed where they passed over the rough edges of the cabin bulkheads.  The fire was probably of electrical origin, caused by a faulty supply cable.  The fire detection system had been intentionally disabled, and much of the emergency equipment was in poor condition.  SHARK was also out of date for her Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) Intermediate Survey.  None of the crew had the required mandatory safety course certificates, the skipper did not hold the required Certificate of Equivalent Competency and no emergency training drills had been carried out.
