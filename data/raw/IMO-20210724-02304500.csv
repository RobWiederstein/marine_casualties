The ship had a maximum draft of about 11.0m and required a suitable ""tidal window"" to navigate the Prince of Wales Channel and Varzin Passage of the Torres Straits. 
At Hay Point a licensed pilot joined the ship, to take charge of the navigation for the passage through the Reef. 
On the evening of 4 November, the ship anchored on the eastern side of Prince of Wales Channel, awaiting a sufficient rise in the sea level to safely navigate Varzin Passage on the western side. At about 23:30 hours, the ship weighed anchor and transited the Prince of Wales Channel. When approaching Varzin Passage at about 02:00 hours, the broadcasting tide gauge at Booby Island indicated there was insufficient water for the ship to pass safely. 
The Pilot decided to delay the ship by turning a wide circle to port. When almost half way through the turn, the M Nuri Cerrahoglu stopped swinging despite port rudder being applied. The ship was travelling slowly and, concerned that the ship might be touching the seabed, the engines were put astern. After 20 to 30 minutes the ship had gained sufficient stern way to take it into safe water, where she was checked for possible damage before passing through Varzin Passage. 
Nobody was hurt as a result of the incident, no damage was reported to the ship and no pollution resulted.

The ship cleared the dock stem first and was then turned to starboard to make the approach to the dredged departure channel. The two tugs were released as soon as the ship had been turned in the swinging basin.
Kapitan Serykh failed to provide sufficient propeller thrust and to gain sufficient speed to fully execute the eighty degrees turn into the departure channel, despite the Pilot's repeated call for full ahead and grounded on the south side of the channel at 09:00 hours.
The ship was refloated, with the assistance of tugs, after about half an hour and returned to Brotherson Dock, where divers ascertained there had been no structural damage to the ship.

A Surveyor from the Australian Maritime Safety Authority boarded the ship to undertake a grain loading inspection and a port state control inspection. 
As part of the port state control inspection, the port lifeboat was lowered to the boat deck and then recovered to its embarkation position at the davit head. In this position the surveyor asked to see the lifeboat engine run ahead and astern. After some minutes, with the engine running but the shaft in neutral, the boat suddenly became detached from the lifeboat falls and fell to the water, a distance of a little under 20 metres. 
In the boat were the Second Mate and two ratings. The Master was just getting in when the boat fell. The four men were admitted to hospital with significant injuries, the Second Mate suffering serious head and spine injuries requiring prolonged hospital care and rehabilitation. 
The boat was recovered from the water and an investigation initiated into the circumstances and causes of the incident.

At about 23:45 hours, after negotiating Gannet Passage and with the ship steadied on a course with Goods Island light right ahead, steering was changed from manual to automatic steering mode. The Pilot then handed the con back to the Master, in order to go below for a few minutes, but before leaving the bridge, at about 23:52 hours, he explained his passage plan, on the chart, for the Torres Strait. 
When the Pilot returned to the bridge at 00:02 hours, the Master and watch officers were at the chart table. Moving through to the wheelhouse, the Pilot initially could not see Goods Island light ahead, but seeing the heading was on 110, he then saw the light wide on the port bow. At the same time, the Master’s attention was brought to the 2400 position on the chart, which was well to the south of the track. The Master ran to the steering console and the rudder was put hard to port. However, after turning through about 70, Thebes ran aground on the south side of Larpent Bank. 
The engine was put to full astern, water ballast was dumped from the forward upper wing tanks and pumped from the forepeak, and the vessel refloated at 01:12 hours on 11 June. Soundings indicated that no tanks had been breached, therefore passage was resumed

Cape Grafton, a diesel/electric powered ship, had arrived in Australia in March, having been built and fitted out in Spain. The ship was on its first operational deployment and was scheduled to carry out routine maintenance on Dent Island lighthouse.
At about 07:40 hours, Cape Grafton started to weigh anchor to move closer to the lighthouse and to make a lee for the work boat, which was used to convey men and materials to the land.
Anchor was weighed at 0:52 hours and the Master manoeuvred towards the lighthouse turning to starboard, away from the island, before making the necessary lee. At about 07:55 hours the ship suffered a total loss of power for a few seconds, this 'blacked out' all means of propulsion and instrumentation for a critical period. Although electrical generating power was restored within a few seconds and machinery was restarted, control was not restored in time to prevent the ship running aground, despite letting go the anchors.
The grounding was relatively minor in nature and Cape Grafton refloated without assistance on the afternoon tide. Nobody was injured and no pollution resulted from the grounding.

The skipper advised Melbourne Marine Communications Service of the situation and later contacted the owner in Cairns. The owner arranged for the Eden based 14.8m work ship Broadwater to tow the ship the 100 or so miles to Eden and also to take out some compressed air bottles to the ship. Broadwater commenced the tow at 03:00 hours on 30 April, but proved inadequate and the tow was relinquished to the fishing ship Rubicon at 12:15 hours on 30 April.
Water had been accumulating in Provincial Trader's engine room bilge from early on 29 April, eventually causing some concern. However, the engineer was able to start the bilge pump after receiving the compressed air bottles and the water level was reduced and stabilised.
When the tow was approaching Twofold Bay, New South Wales, early on 1 May, Provincial Trader's engine room suddenly and rapidly filled with water and the skipper ordered the crew to abandon ship. Provincial Trader sank just 530m outside the Eden port limits, the crew being rescued by Rubicon.

Before morning tea, the Extra Second Engineer showed the Engineer Cadet, the forward domestic fresh water pump and gave him instructions on how to remove the pump to the workshop for overhaul, a task that the Cadet was to undertake after the morning tea break. The Extra Second, in preparation for removal of the pump, ensured that the pump starter isolator and selector switches were in the ""off'"" position. As the Extra Second was quite clear in his mind that the job involved no electrical work, the fuses were not removed and no ""danger"" tag was attached to the starter.
During the morning tea break, the Fifth Engineer who was the duty engineer for the day, responded to an engine room alarm which indicated a fault on the vessel's 24 volt DC system, a common cause for alarms.
Shortly after the tea break, the Fifth Engineer again responded to an alarm which he took to be another 24 volt DC earth fault, but which cleared as soon as he ""cancelled"" the alarm. Later evidence showed that it had been an earth fault on the 440 volt system, in all probability caused by the Cadet having come into contact with a ""live"" terminal within the starter box for the forward fresh water pump.
At approximately 11:13 hours, some 34 minutes later, the Third Engineer came across the Cadet lying on the deck between the fresh water pumps and the calorifiers. He was not breathing and no pulse could be detected. The door to the starter box for the forward fresh water pump was open and the isolating switch was in the ""on"" position. The ship's emergency team was called and resuscitation techniques were applied but without success.
A helicopter, attending the Griffin Venture, was tasked to land on the deck of Australian Achiever and to airlift the Cadet to hospital at Exmouth. Resuscitation techniques were applied throughout the flight but, shortly after arrival, the Cadet was declared dead by hospital staff.

Anchor handling ship do not navigate in the accepted meaning of the term, but are directed to go in directions determined by the person controlling the operation on board the parent vessel, in this case, using a differential global positioning system and monitor. 
In the immediate area of Boa Force's operation, there was a pipeline, marked at regular intervals with temporary buoys and an unmarked subsea wellhead, standing about 3m high in a general seabed depth of under 8m of water. The well itself was not active and had been capped and suspended for some time. To the west, and about 70m from the wellhead, a new pipeline had been laid, running from oil production platforms to Thevenard Island. 
At about 02:20 hours Western Australian Standard Time, Boa Force recovered the barge's number one anchor from close to the wellhead. Those on the barge were concerned with the proximity of the wire to the wellhead. Boa Force was ordered to go in a northerly direction to ensure that the wire was clear, before the barge recovered the wire prior to repositioning the anchor. 
At about 02:50 hours, while moving stem first towards the barge, Boa Force hit the wellhead and holed the engine room space in the only area where the ship did not have a double hull. 
Despite efforts by the Chief Engineer, the Second Engineer and an Integrated Rating, the ship's pumps could not keep up with the ingress of water. A launch was sent from the Support Station III to stand by Boa Force. A little before 03:45 hours, the Master ordered the crew to abandon Boa Force and by 03:45 hours the complement of eleven were on board the launch. 
The vessel sank, to the seabed partially supported by the wellhead. A boom was deployed to combat any pollution. 
An operation to raise and dispose of Boa Force was completed on 6 April. This involved lifting Boa Force clear of the wellhead, patching the breach in the hull, and recovering all oil and other pollutants. The ship was then towed beyond the continental shelf and scuttled.

Although the hull was penetrated in way of three ballast tanks, once the situation had been stabilised the ship was able to continue its voyage to Melbourne.
The Master had been appointed to the ship at short notice and had little experience of the port, where masters have to do their own pilotage. With the leading marks obscured, there were no other visual aids to indicate the ship's location with respect to the centre of the 150m wide channel.

The ship had received clearance to enter from Point Lonsdale Signal Station, which also advised of the A M Vella dredging operation.
The weather was fine, with good visibility, however, with the sun having set, the light was fading rapidly.
At 21:50 hours, while trying, to pass A M Vella ""port to port"", Searoad Mersey made contact with No. 15 beacon, on the south side of the channel, then at about 21:51 hoours, collided with AM Vella, striking the dredger on its starboard side, immediately abaft the forecastle.
Both vessels sustained damage, but no-one was injured and no pollution occurred as a result of the collision

At about 14:20 hours, aviation jet fuel (Avtur) was being loaded into No.5 port and starboard wing tanks and nearing, the required finishing, ullage in both tanks when the duty mate in the cargo control room shut No.5 port wing tank filling valve. This action put the full loading rate, of about 1200 m /hour, into No.5 starboard tank and, shortly afterwards, cargo overflowed onto the deck from the pressure/vacuum release valve on No.5 starboard cargo tank. 

Immediately, shore pumping was stopped, no.1 centre was opened as a ""crash tank"" and the manifold valves and all cargo tank filling valves were closed. 
When the clean up of the spilt oil was completed, soundings were taken of all cargo tanks. From these, it was established that the level in No.5 starboard tank was falling, while that in No.4 starboard was increasing - an indication that these two tanks were now common in some way. 
The cargo in Nos.4 and 5 starboard tanks was pumped to other tanks in the ship and the two tanks were then cleaned and gas-freed prior to being inspected. 

Inspection revealed that there was extensive damage to the structure between the two tanks caused by No.5 starboard tank having been hydraulically over-pressurised. The bulkhead had ruptured, leaving a hole of approximately 1 X 1.5 metres. Various other sections of the corrugated bulkhead were bulging, and a weld fracture was found in the aft bulkhead of No.5 starboard tank.
The ship was eventually allowed to load its original cargo and to proceed to Sydney and thence Geelong, for temporary repairs.
