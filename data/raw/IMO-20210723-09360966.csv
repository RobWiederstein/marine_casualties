The ASD was subsequently evacuated from the tank and was conveyed ashore, but lost vital signs enroute.

The investigation revealed that the ASD had entered the cargo tank, which had been earlier declared as gas-free, after a prolonged break without carrying out any checks on the tank atmosphere. The crew had not been provided with personal gas detectors and there was no safety equipment kept on standby at the entrance of the enclosed space being entered. The permits to work issued for the space were, according to the Chief Officer, closed and no entry was permitted but the space had not been safeguarded from unauthorised entry. 
 
The investigation also revealed that inappropriate method was used to gas free the cargo oil tank by connecting the ventilation blowers via chutes to the manifolds, without flushing the pipelines to remove remnants of the previous cargo. In addition, the investigation discovered that proper procedures were not followed for enclosed space entry and there were gaps identified in the implementation of the Safety Management System (SMS) on board.

When the fire occurred, the vessel with a crew of six, was on its way to Haugesund to seek shelter from the weather. When the vessel was north of Rvr the captain observed that the fire alarm central indicated a fire in the workshop. The captain went out of the wheelhouse and observed that smoke came out of the workshop. The rest of the crew were immediately alarmed and tried to put out the fire. However they understood shortly that they would not be able to control the fire since it developed rapidly. Simultaneously the captain sent a distress call and informed that they had to evacuate the vessel due to the extensive fire. The crew put on their survival suits and evacuated to the life raft of the passenger vessel Rvrfjord which had arrived at the location. Due to the fire, the vessel sank late in the evening the same day. The investigation has shown that it cannot be concluded if the fire originated in the vessels technical switchboard room or in the adjacent workshop, separated by a lining. The development of the fire indicate that the fire has started in one of the rooms and spread to both rooms and further into the vessel. The investigation has shown that the approval of the vessels structural fire protection for the workshop and the technical switchboard room was not correct. This was mainly based on the fact that the drawings of the structural fire protection sent to the Norwegian Maritime Authority by the shipowner was insufficient. The shipowner had not carried out emergency preparedness training with regards to fire, and emergency preparedness training was not described in the shipowners safety management system. The Norwegian accident investigation board has not identified that lack of training was decisive in this event, however this is something the shipowner is responsible of carrying out according to the regulations, and may be crucial in accident scenarios. The Norwegian accident investigation board issues a safety recommendation to the shipowner in that respect.","Fish Catching Vessel","Total loss of the ship","420","","","","6","0","","0","0","0","0","0","0","2019-09-24",""

The frigate had 137 persons on board with a mix of conscripts and permanent crew. A total of seven watchstanding personnel were present on the bridge, including two trainees. The tanker Sola TS was operated by the Greek shipping company Tsakos Columbia Shipmanagement (TCM) S.A. There was a total of 24 persons on board. The bridge was manned by four persons, including the pilot. HNoMS Helge Ingstad sailed south at a speed of approximately 1718 knots with the automatic identification system (AIS) in passive mode, i.e. no transmission of AIS-signal. The frigates bridge team had notified Fedje Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) of entering the area and followed the reported voyage. Sola TS had been loaded with crude oil at the Sture Terminal, and notified Fedje VTS of departure from the terminal. Sola TS exhibited navigation lights. In addition some of the deck lights were turned on to light up the deck for the crew who were securing equipment etc. for the passage. In advance of the collision, Fedje VTS had not followed the frigates passage south through the Hjeltefjord. The crew and pilot on Sola TS had observed HNoMS Helge Ingstad and tried to warn of the danger and prevent a collision. The crew on HNoMS Helge Ingstad did not realise that they were on collision course until it was too late. At 04:01:15, HNoMS Helge Ingstad collided with the tanker Sola TS. The first point of impact was Sola TS starboard anchor and the area just in front of HNoMS Helge Ingstads starboard torpedo magazine. HNoMS Helge Ingstad suffered extensive damage along the starboard side. Seven crew members sustained minor physical injuries. Sola TS received minor damages and none of the crew were injured. Marine gas oil leaked out into the Hjeltefjord. The Institute of Marine Research has ascertained the effect of the oil spill had little impact on the marine environment. The AIBNs investigation has shown that the situation in the Hjeltefjord was made possible by a number of operational, technical, organisational and systemic factors: - As a consequence of the clearance process, the career ladder for fleet officers in the Navy and the shortage of qualified navigators to man the frigates, officers of the watch had been granted clearance sooner, had a lower level of experience and had less time as officer of the watch than used to be the case. This had also resulted in inexperienced officers of the watch being assigned responsibility for training. Furthermore, several aspects of the bridge service were not adequately described or standardised. The night of the accident, it turned out, among other things, that the bridge team on HNoMS Helge Ingstad did not manage to utilise the teams human and technical resources to detect, while there was still time, that what they thought was a stationary object giving off the strong lights, in fact was a vessel on collision course. Organisation, leadership and teamwork on the bridge were not expedient during the period leading up to the collision. In combination with the officer of the watchs limited experience, the training being conducted for two watchstanding functions on the bridge reduced the bridge teams capacity to address the overall traffic situation. Based on a firmly lodged situational awareness that the object was stationary and that the passage was under control, little use was made of the radar and AIS to monitor the fairway. - When Sola TS set out on its northbound passage with the forward-pointing deck lights turned on, it was difficult for the frigates bridge team to see the tankers navigation lights and the flashing of the Aldis lamp, and thereby identify the object as a vessel. The shipping company Tsakos Columbia Shipmanagement SA had not established compensatory safety measures with regards to the reduction of the visibility of the navigation lights due to deck lighting. Furthermore, radar plotting and communication on the bridge did not sufficiently ensure the effect of active teamwork to build a common situational awareness. This could have increased the time window for identification and warning of the frigate. - The Norwegian Coastal Administration (NCA) had not established human, technical and organisational barriers to ensure adequate traffic monitoring. The functionality of the monitoring system with regards to automatic plotting, warning and alarm functions, was not sufficiently adapted to the execution of the vessel traffic service. Lack of monitoring meant that the VTS operators situational awareness and overview of the VTS area were inadequate. Hence, Fedje VTS did not provide the vessels involved with relevant and timely information and did not organise the traffic to ensure the tankers safe departure from the Sture Terminal. - On the southbound voyage, HNoMS Helge Ingstad sailed with AIS in passive mode. This meant that the frigate could not be immediately identified on the screens at Fedje VTS or Sola TS. None of the parties involved made sufficient use of available technical aids. It was a challenge for maritime safety that the Navy could operate without AIS transmission and without compensatory safety measures within a traffic system where the other players largely used AIS as their primary (and to some extent only) source of information. The Accident Investigation Board Norway submits a total of 15 safety recommendations based on the investigation of the sequence of events leading up to the collision. Information and any safety recommendations relating to the sequence of events after the collision up until the time that the frigate ran aground and sank, will be included in the part two report.","Oil Tanker","","62557","","112939","","24","0","","0","0","0","0","0","0","2019-12-29",""

After the collision, Begonia S continued its voyage and Mietus II stopped in a drift. As a result of the collision, the bow part of the yacht was damaged and water flooded its interior. At 04:55 the skipper sent a distress message by VHF and at that time the crew and passengers of the yacht were launching the raft. At the command of the skipper, passengers and crew, a total of 16 people of Polish nationality took seats in the raft. After checking the muster list, the painter of the raft attached to the side of the yacht was cut off. Danish emergency services sent helicopters and two rescue units: FRB19 and Mads Jakobsen. FRB-19 took on board a passenger with a head injury, and the other vessel took the remaining 15 survivors from the raft, and both rescue vessels went to the port of Rnne to provide medical assistance to the survivors. During the rescue operation, Begonia S, which returned to the scene of the accident, offered its help to the rescuers.

She had to travel through Corsica Channel TSS and was following her usual courses. At about fifteen nautical miles north of cap Corse, at 11 nautical miles from the Corsica Channel TSS precautionary area, was the container ship CSL VIRGINIA riding at anchor. At 07.02 am, ULYSSE struck violently CSL VIRGINIA on her starboard beam. Both vessels remained stuck. There were no fatalities or injuries but an oil pollution of about 520 cubic metre had been reported, as CSL VIRGINIA had lost most of the fuel oil contained in a fuel tank. The oil slick had spread and reached the coastline, Var beaches particularly. Significant antipollution means had been operated. Pulled apart after a few days, the vessel ULYSSE sailed to Tunisia to unload her cargo and to be repaired there. CSL VIRGINIA sailed to Turkey, after having changed her name and flag. The collision on 7 October at 7.02 am is the consequence of a major lack of look-out on board ULYSSE, combined with legal but an unwise anchoring position and a lack of attentive traffic monitoring from CSL VIRGINIA. On board ULYSSE, the lack of look-out was caused by the lack of involvement of the officer of the watch before the collision. The lack of look-out could not be compensated by the helmsman, gone for a patrol and thus absent from the bridge. In the watch position taken, seated on starboard facing an out-of-order radar, located just in front of him, the officer of the watch was deprived of information enabling him to assess the situation. However, the use of the other radar on port side, switched on, would have provided all the data for him to assess a critical situation. Moreover his watch position, too low, did not allow him to see correctly the sea-line. There was little or no enforcement of watch related procedures aboard both vessels. COLREG convention was not properly implemented. The human component was the major factor causing the accident, with a lack of appreciation of the responsibilities related to the officer of the watch position. A boredom factor, related to the length of sea-going periods, has certainly had an effect on the involvement of the officers of the watch on board both vessels. On board both vessels, the use of mobile phone for personal concerns took precedence over the officer of the watch duties, leading to a lack of surface situation monitoring. In addition, as it was a deep sea area, no information was delivered to the vessels transiting in the vicinity of the unusual point of mooring chosen by CSL VIRGINIA. Learnings 1. 2019-E-09: The use of a mobile phone can fully monopolise the officer of the watch and turn him away from the look-out. 2. 2019-E-10: COLREG convention does not exempt from organising the look-out at anchor. 3. 2019-E-11: Checking solely AIS data is not appropriate for collision avoidance, its conditions of use are clearly stated in IMO A1106 (29) resolution. 4. 2019-E-12: A non-regulated and not prohibited deep-sea anchorage is not for all that convenient. Actually, maritime routes and traffic should be taken into account for the choice of a deep-sea anchorage outside the regulated areas, particularly in the vicinity of a traffic separation scheme.","Container Ship","Pollution,Ship rendered unfit to proceed","54592","","66644","","24","0","24","0","0","0","0","0","0","2020-02-17",""

The slops, which were being loaded in cargo tank no. 5 port, were noted by the crew members to have a pungent odour of rotten egg. Following departure and while on passage, the slops were pumped out at sea and the crew started cleaning the cargo tanks. The following morning, at about 0405, two crew members involved in the cleaning and washing of cargo tanks were found lying motionless inside cargo tank no. 5 port. The crew members were rescued and airlifted to a hospital in Norway. A summary of the autopsy report submitted by the Accident Investigation Board of Norway concluded that the injuries sustained by the crew members were compatible with a fall from a considerable height. The injuries may have been fatal, but based on the circumstances of the accident, the autopsy report indicated that it was possible that the cause of death was either intoxication by Hydrogen Sulphide (H2S), or suffocation due to lack of oxygen.","Oil Tanker","Loss of life","3693","RINA Services S.p.A (RINA)","","","14","0","0","2","0","0","0","0","0","2019-12-31",""

Many of the 125 persons on board, mainly French pensioners, were standing on the open deck during arrival. Many of them fell during the collision with the quay. Almost one third of the passengers and one crew member suffered varying degrees of injury. In the winter 2018, a service engineer overhauled the engine gearbox, but the supplier of the manoeuvring system was not contacted to ensure optimal adjustment of pitch and loading. The port drivelines propeller pitch was not correctly adjusted after this gearbox overhaul. This caused severe stress at certain rpm settings and vibrations in the vessel. Challenges caused by vibrations in the vessel on cruising speed continued when the vessel had started to operate around Svalbard. The responsible for the vessel did themselves try to readjust the system. When this was not successful, it was decided to operate Aurora Explorer in combinator mode during docking, and in back-up mode to reach cruising speed between destinations, in order to limit unwanted vibrations. If the manoeuvre system still was in back-up mode on arrival Barentsburg on 15 July with forward pitch on the port driveline, the rpm would have increased as the port side manoeuvre handle was pulled astern, and the vessel would as a result also increase its speed ahead. The AIBNs investigation has shown that the shipping company did not document the potential risks to passengers and crew from the change in operational mode. In order to ensure the safety of passengers and crew on board, the AIBN submits a safety recommendation to Arctic Explorer AS, in which it requests the company to carry out and document risk assessments when operational changes are made.","Passenger Ship","Serious injuries,Ship rendered unfit to proceed","177","RINA Services S.p.A (RINA)","20","","4","121","","0","0","0","1","9","0","2019-07-31",""

The fitting of this water pump does not coincide with that of the ""JOVENNA IV"", so they can't use it.
 Around 12h10, the Chief Engineer informed the master that the height of the sea  water inside the engine room is 1.5 m. The captain decided to abandon ship:  contacted the ship ""THERESY"" to get closer to him to retrieve the crew and passengers, ordered the crew members and passengers to put on their life jackets, lowered  the two life rafts in the water, launched lifebuoys into the water, recovered  ship's and crew documents.

The crane was at a 45 degree position at the time of failure. The crane was manually turned and secured to a seagoing stowage position in accordance with the vessel's safety management system and at 2143 hours the vessel departed Nagoya making way towards Davao port. Before reaching Davao, it was decided to move the crane to make the vessel ready for discharging operation using a shore crane in Davao port. On 01 May the Master approved the decision to swing crane no.1 manually. Initially it was decided to move the crane by fastening the hook to crane 2 on the jib of crane no.1 to take it out from the jib support and manually slew it using mooring ropes and secure it using chain blocks to allow for discharge of the cargo at the discharge port. However, the attempt to lift the jib of crane no.1 was unsuccessful with this method due to the limitation imposed by the safe working load of crane no.2. 

The Master authorized to cut the jib support plate of crane no.1 using the gas cutting operation and move the crane towards the intended resting position. Subsequently, the Fitter was tasked to cut the jib support plate of crane no.1. The Bosun was tasked to operate crane no.2 from the inside the crane cabin while an AB was assisting the fitter on the crane platform. 

At 1716 hours, shortly after the gas cutting operation was complete the Chief Officer who was also on crane no.2 noticed some movement of the jib support towards the center line of the vessel and towards the Fitter. The movement of the crane jib resulted in the Fitter to be struck between the jib of crane no.1 and tower of crane no.2. The impact led to Fitters instantaneous death.

What is your intention?”, however, there was no answer, then 2/O ordered duty AB-1 “hard starboard”, the duty AB-1 took helm to “hard starboard”. 
As soon as 2/O gave the command to alter course hard starboard and called to the other vessel on VHF CH.16 again where it was still no answer, the Master came out from the computer room and looked out the port side bridge doorway and saw the other vessel, the Master then ordered the duty AB-1 to maintain hard starboard.

As the other vessel MV.COSCO SHIPPING LEO was on sea trailing navigating at sea, the freeboard was very high, her starboard bow was collided into engine funnel exhaust pipe, radar mast, deck cranes house post, forward mast and boom resting support on forecastle deck.
At about 1330 hours, the own vessel stopped the main engine and immediately checked the vessel’s condition, at about 2120 hours, the vessel sailed from the incident water area, bound for Busan, Korea for investigation and repairs.

A pilot was advising the master. A canal helmsman steered the ship. Both manoeuvring stations had been manned for the entry into the lock. After the prescribed astern manoeuvre using the controllable pitch propeller (CPP) system, the AKACIA was to be put back on a course for entry into the lock. The pilot assisted this by setting the pitch to 20% ahead. Shortly afterwards, the first audible alarm sounded and the pilot noticed an increase in the ship's speed. The increase in speed resulted from the fact that the pitch of the propeller blades had continued to rise to 100% and above without the control lever being operated. The master initially attempted to adjust the pitch by operating the control lever in the normal manner, which proved unsuccessful. He then switched to backup control but it was still not possible to adjust the pitch. The investigators are of the opinion that another option to intervene did not exist. All other measures of the ship's command, such as an emergency anchoring manoeuvre with both anchors and a main engine emergency stop failed to lead to a significant reduction in speed. Consequently, the lock gate was hit at 2354 at high speed. Part of the ship's fore section broke through the gate, her bow sustaining heavy damage in the process. Damage caused by an earlier contact with a solid object was found on the propeller blades and inside the propeller hub during the investigation. Resulting fragments were then transported through the CPP system's hydraulics. The investigators believe one of the fragments blocked the valve needed to adjust the pitch at the time the system failed. Nobody lost their life or was injured due to the allision with the lock gate and there was no water pollution.

At the time, the vessel was in ballast condition. Preliminary information indicated that Hephaestus, which had been at anchor for some days in position 35 58.9 N 014 25.30 E, i.e., approximately 1.5 nautical miles (NM) from the shoreline, in Bunkering Area No. 1, dragged her anchor in Force 8 winds, gusting to Force 10, and eventually went aground. Some of the ships bunkers and/or oily-water from the bilges escaped from the vessel several days after the grounding and eventually booms had to be deployed around the wreck. As a result of the grounding, the vessel sustained extensive structural damages. The seven crew members, who disembarked from the vessel directly on the rocky shore using the vessels pilot ladder, reported no serious injuries. The safety investigation concluded that during the adverse weather conditions, the vessel was in unsheltered waters, which compromised the safety of the vessel.","Oil Tanker","Pollution,Ship rendered unfit to proceed","595","International Naval Surveys Bureau (INSB)","885","","7","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","2019-12-31",""
