The fire started in the port side lift fan compartment and within 15 minutes after the fire was visually detected the craft was engulfed in flames and drifted uncontrollably until it grounded in the shallow waters north of the harbour of Bagenkop, Denmark, and was lost. The fire was caused by insufficient cooling of the lift fan engine exhaust system, which ignited the exhaust muffler and/or the compartment where it was mounted. After the discovery of the fire, the crew had no other option than to evacuate the craft without any attempt to fight the fire manually and/or by means of the craft’s fixed firefighting systems. The overall aim of the investigation was to establish why a failure of the cooling water system led to an uncontrollable fire that resulted in a total loss of the craft. The focus of the investigation was UMOE VENTUS’ robustness towards fire. In order to increase robustness of the vessel, the shipyard has implemented certain measures on the sister ship currently operating in wind farms and on existing and future new builds.","Other Offshore Ship","Ship rendered unfit to proceed,Total loss of the ship","217","[Other]","14.9","","3","1","0","","","","","","","2018-07-24",""

Subsequently this rendered the vessel unable to sail and continue passenger operations. However all guests were safely evacuated and transferred ashore with assistance from sister ship Star Breeze and passing vessel ''Terra Moana''. No oil sheen observed or injuries to either passengers or crew were reported.    

The vessel anchored off Coiba which allowed some passengers to be transferred to the ''Terra Moana'' and transported to Golfito, Costa Rica to be disembarked. 

On the 23rd December, the on scene vessel Star Breeze departed Coiba at 0316 LT enroute to Golfito with all remaining guests (106) from the Star Pride. From there they were transferred to San Jose, Costa Rica, where they were given the option to stay in Costa Rica for the remainder of their vacation or fly home early.

As of the 24th December, all guests and all but 5 crew were removed from the vessel. 

The vessel's next cruise scheduled for December 26th were cancelled along with the Star Pride’s January 2nd and 9th voyages. 

As of the 29th December, damage and stability assessments continued under Class supervision and arrangements to facilitate tow to the port of Balboa for repairs were being made.

No work permit was issued for this maintenance job, since the work would take place at a height of only just over one metre and in an area secured by railings.
The able bodied seaman (AB) who carried out the maintenance work told the bosun that, while carrying out the work, he had observed that the forward hook for the free-fall lifeboat was in need of lubrication, and he asked the bosun for help to steady the ladder he had erected in the position of the forward hook in the davit.
According to the bosun, he tried to prevent the work operation from being carried out, but he nonetheless held on to the lower part of the ladder while the AB climbed up without any form of fall protection. When the AB had climbed part of the way up the ladder, it suddenly slipped on the deck without the bosun being able to keep it steady or stop it from slipping. The AB fell along with the ladder and ended up motionless on the deck next to the ladder.

The cargo Ethylene a colorless flammable gas with a faint sweet musky odor when pure, is widely used in the chemical industry as an organic compound for the production of polyethylene, a widely used polymer plastic. Ethylene is also an important natural plant hormone, used in agriculture to force ripening of fruits. Ethylene’s hydrate is ethyl alcohol. As a vessel that carries Ethylene as a cargo, is built with pressurized cargo tanks and have the ability to carry not only most of the liquefied gas cargoes, but also designed to carry Ethylene fully refrigerated at its atmospheric pressure in a temperature of -104ºC. Ethylene is kept refrigerated on board in order to load and maintain it in a liquefied state reducing its volume and for safe carriage in her cargo tanks. The cargo tanks of the vessel is specified and built to maintain temperatures as low as -104ºC and pressures up to 5.4 bars. 
 The investigation determines that the fire was caused by a gas leakage of R1270 propylene from cylinders stowed by the catwalk at the top of the compressor room and was ignited through static charge. The R1270 propylene gas stored in cylinders that caused the fire is a natural flammable refrigerant suitable for use in low and medium temperature refrigeration applications, it is used to charge and maintain the vessel

After arrival the crew began lowering the vessels ramps in order to unload the ro-ro cargo on board. When the stevedores were about to start up and prepare the upper ramp ashore they noted that several alarms at the port's land ramp that would be placed on the vessels upper car deck. The supervisor was called and when he arrived, he took no other action than to acknowledge the alarms. When the green light was given from the vessel to lower the port's upper ramp another stevedore went to the control station to lower the ramp. He also noted the alarm about a sensor fault on the flap and he acknowledged alarms without further action, as was customary for operators in the workplace since the inauguration of the port 2011. Then he lowered the ramp on the vessel's upper deck. Just seconds before the operator released the button, a crewman adjusted a movable metal cap on the car deck with his foot in order to improve the ability of the flap's free float sensor to make contact with the ship's deck. When the operator released the button the flap fell rapidly and uncontrollably down onto the car deck. The falling flap hit the crew member and squeezed the crew member legs hard between the flap and the ship's car deck. The injured crew member received severe injuries to both legs and was treated for several months in hospital. The accident was caused by the flap, one and only float sensor, was damaged and in an activated position, with the result that the flap rapidly and uncontrollably fell down when the control button was released. Contributing factors were that the ramp was maneuvered and could be maneuvered despite a serious error alarm and without any technical inspection being made due to the faulty alarm concerned, and that the crew of the vessel routinely placed a metal cap between the vessel's car deck and float sensor to compensate for deficiencies to the ramp function. Underlying factors were the port's lack of leadership and management of operations and deficiencies in the vessels safety culture.","Passenger / Ro-Ro Cargo Ship","Serious injuries","33313","RINA Services S.p.A (RINA)","11600","","34","163","","","","","1","","","2020-12-09",""

The mission included transportation of stones of different fractions from a temporary loading port in Lilla Edet further north in the G ta lv to a specific unloading area. The transport was performed with a smaller tug, RING, which was attached to push a barge. The crew consisted of the master and a deckman. Visibility from the tug was limited due to the low position of the wheelhouse. The loading of the barge was carried out so that the barge got a stern trim in order to obtain satisfactory visibility from the wheelhouse. The barge had some heel to the port at the departure. The barge was not certified and not provided with any draft mark that showed the barge maximum load capacity. The head current in the river was just over one knot during the day, but could vary in different locations in the river. The barge's heel to port and low freeboard, contributed to the fact that, during the voyage, occasionally seawater came up on the barge deck. After 1 to 2 hours voyage, the current became stronger, and the barge's heel increased, and more seawater washed up on the barge deck. Despite speed reduction, the barge's heel did not decrease. The master took the decision to disconnect the barge from RING. The tugboat was not equipped with quick release hooks regarding the wire connections. When slack occurred in the port wire connection, the heel of the barge increased further and some cargo shift occurred. When the barge deck cut down under the water, the last positive residual stability disappeared, and the barge capsized and ended up floating upside down. The barge wire connections to the tug turned RING around and down under the water and it sank quickly. The crew was equipped with inflatable life jackets and managed to swim to shore. The cause of the accident was that the barge was loaded so that the residual stability (dynamic stability) was almost nonexistent and thus the barge was sensitive to external disturbances in the form of additional heeling moment. Cooperation between the water on the barge deck, some cargo shifting and the slack of the wire connection contributed to the positive residual stability not being sufficient to maintain positive stability of the barge. A contributory factor was that the barge was not provided with a draft mark for maximum loading condition. Contributing was also that the tugboat RING was not equipped with quick release hooks regarding the wire connections to the barge, and that visibility from the wheelhouse was limited when pushing the barge. An underlying cause of the accident is the lack of requirements for smaller barges without their own steering gear which are not classified as vessels and are not subject to supervision or certification requirements.","Towing / Pushing Tug","Serious injuries,Ship rendered unfit to proceed","11.9","","","","2","0","","","","","1","","","2020-12-09",""

At one point, the fisherman watching the exit of the rings of the line was dragged into the water by tackle. Immediately, his fellows raised the alarm and the skipper stopped the engine and started the maneuver to heave up the section of the tackle that had been dropped. Some of the crew jumped into the water, and they were able to release the victim from the trapping rope and hoist him , with no signs of life, to the deck. Once there, they started resuscitation procedures, but they were useless.CONCLUSIONSFrom the autopsy report and the statements of the crew it is clear that the immediate cause of the accident was the entrapment of the leg of the victim by one of the crowsfeet that join the rings of the floating line to the leads line. This entrapment occurred when the fisherman left the safe area and get too close to the area where the crowsfeet were stowed. The investigation has not been able to conclude what were the causes that led to the victim to carry out this action, however indications were found that this was a more habitual behavior than desirable in purse seine fishing. The lack of separation barriers of the safe area and the stowage of the rings of the floating line favored this behavior.","Fish Catching Vessel","Loss of life","114.23","","","","10","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","2019-10-25",""

At 22:29 hours, the Port Emergency Plan was activated (PEI), having previously alerted to the Port Authority, Maritime Captaincy, Maritime Rescue, Fire and sanitary services. The Rescue Coordination Center of Las Palmas (CCS Las Palmas) mobilized several vessels and rescue boats. All the personnel on board were evacuated to the ground and the firemen proceeded to try to extinguish the fire from the ground while the maritime means acted from the sea. Firefighting operations spread over several days and the fire could be extinguished. As the vessel was Russian flagged, the CIAIM tried to contact with its equivalent in Russia, with no response. CONCLUSIONSThe CIAIM has not been able to establish with certainty the cause of the fire, but estimates that the most plausible hypothesis is a fire of electrical origin in some of the electrical panels of the control room of the fish factory. The following factors contributed to the spread of fire and the impossibility of its early extinction: - The absence of smoke detectors throughout the factory, and especially in the factory control room. - The bulkheads delimiting the factory control room do not have structural fire protection. - The fire pumps are electrically operated and were powered exclusively from the main switchboard, and therefore could not be used when the ship was left without electricity supply.","Fish Catching Vessel","Ship rendered unfit to proceed","7765","Russian Maritime Register of Shipping (RMRS)","","","55","0","","","","","","","","2019-11-19",""

The cargo was completed discharging at 1759lt in the evening on 14th October 2015, then the deck crew commenced to close tween deck pontoons in hold no.1 and no.2 where the pontoons were lifted, opened or placed it by the pontoon trolley underneath the hold hatch coaming, after that they started to carry out the hold washing as per the voyage instruction Voyage no.513 one by one hold by using pressure washier machine provided with only one hose connection (only one pressure washer machine, one hold by one hold, and one hose connection only).

At 2000lt, Crew started fresh water washing in hold no.1 (upper hold on tween deck no.1 and lower hold below it) by high pressure washer.

At 2130lt, Crew finished it in hold no.1 and changed to start fresh water washing in upper hold on no.2 tween deck by high pressure washer by deck members: 2/O, 3/O, Bosun and one AB.

At 2210lt, 3/O and AB on no.2 tween deck opened 1 pontoon (no.10 pontoon on tween deck no.2 aft part) in order to put the hose connection into the lower hold to continuous washing it. After opening the pontoon, AB went to assist the 2/O washing the no.7-9 pontoons on starboard side, while the 3/O went to portside forward corner and held a squeegee in his hand and doing the squeegee to clean, dry, pull the water into lower hold backward to portside aft part.

At 2215lt, when deck crew almost finished washing no.2 upper hold, 2/O heard a sharp sound and a sudden impact in no.2 lower hold and he saw the 3/O lying on tank top of no.2 lower hold, the 2/O immediately reported to C/O and Master by walkie talkie.

At 2217lt, C/O went to mess room, called and reported Master by interior telephone that the 3/O fell down into the lower hold no.2.

At 2220lt, Master called the agent that 3/O fell down into the lower hold no.2 need ambulance. Also, Captain informed the Marine Supervisor for DCKK who was still on board at the time of accident happened, Captain also called to the Company DPA about the accident.

At 2240lt, the Ambulance arrived at wharf side, the shore doctor carried out artificial respiration for the casualty about 5-10mins, then the Ambulance departed wharf carrying the casualty body.
 
At 0420lt on 15th October 2015, the local agent informed the Master that the casualty passed away at 0004lt on 15th October 2015.

The Casualty 3/O was picked up from the tank top in hold no.2 by using deck crane no.2, moved on a stretcher in the cargo net sling with the assistance of the crew members to the wharf side area. 
As per the advice from the local agent, the casualty passed away at 0004lt on 15th October 2015.
The Casualty fell down to the tank top in hold no.2 from tween deck at a height of about 6 meters and injured his head.
As advice by the hospital, over one hour passed since cardiopulmonary arrest was confirmed. It is conceivable that the cause of death was head injury and left side of fracture of femur accompanied with loss of blood as a result of the fell down incident.
The report concludes that the Casualty 3/O assisted to close the pontoons in no.2 cargo hold after completion discharging cargo in no.2 cargo hold, and then the deck hands started to wash in no.2 cargo hold after they finished washing in hold no.1.

The Casualty 3/O was found that he was the first time joined for the hold washing on tween deck on board this ship. Noticed that he has worn a safety helmet and working shoes-the safety helmet and squeegee were found aside his body when he fell down and lying face down on the tank top of no.2 lower hold.

On the date of investigation on 23rd December, 2105 at Shanghai, China, we found that the Portside Mid Manhole cover was in opened condition when the no.10 pontoons was also in opened condition on the date of incident on 14th October 2015.

The 3/O was doing squeegee to clean, dry, pull the water into lower hold backward to portside forward to aft part, the last time crew 2/O saw him was on the position nearby the Portside Mid Manhole cover which is only about 2.7 meters away from the gap of the opening no.10 pontoon on tween deck no.2.

The portside coaming tween deck walkway is only about 1.35 meters where the Mid Manhole cover (0.45 x 0.45 m2) on it on frame no.53-54 while the opened no.10 pontoon on tween deck no.2 (2.25 x 12.50 m2).

No handrail stanchion were installed with connecting guard lines on port and starboard tween deck in line of pontoons, and both the opened no.10 pontoon area and opened portside mid manhole cover on tween deck no.2 were not properly established with safety guard lines, warning signs etc.  

Nobody has seen that how and what caused his falling down into the no.2 lower hold area just under the opened no.10 pontoon on tween deck no.2.
 
The report recommended that when the 3/O was working on the tween deck portside nearby the opened no.10 pontoon area should consider it was a height working since the gap of the opened area has a height of 6 meters above.

No self-secure lines, stanchion and guard lines established caused his both hands lost any hand grip when he might fell down on tween deck, slip off, momentary loss of attention / lapse of concentration in regard to his footing and surroundings on the nearby of the opened no.10 pontoon, being the direct cause of his falling into the tank top in low hold no.2.

After that conversation, it appears that the ship's Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon (EPIRB) was activated, whose signal was received by the USCG in Portsmouth, VA. This signal prompted the USCG to contact the vessel owners, who informed them of the ship's reported condition. Subsequent attempts by the USCG to open communications with El Faro since October 1st have been unsuccessful. At the time of disappearance, El Faro had a crew of 28 US citizens and five Polish supernumeraries. Marine Traffic last reported position of El Faro was 24.2742 N 072.94522 E on 01 October 04:01.
On October 1st, Hurricane Hunters aircraft made attempts to locate El Faro without result. Beginning on Friday, October 2nd the USCG commenced a dedicated search for the ship with HC-130 aircraft which continued on Saturday October 3rd, with additional resources, including helicopters, cutters, and commercial tugboats. On that date, a life ring belonging to El Faro was recovered 70 miles northeast of the last known location of the ship. On the morning of Sunday, October 4th, the search was resumed.","Container Ship","","","","","","","","","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","2018-05-18","2020-03-16"

There were several fishing vessels within 4 or 5 miles from Tu Ru Bong 3.

At about 0123 hours, the master and crew on the deck of Tu Ru Bong 3 found by eye a very large vessel coming closer 0.3 nm distance to portside, and left their seats shouting.

At about 0125 hours, the starboard bow of the very large vessel collided with the portside plate of Tu Ru Bong 3.

When the large vessel was passing, the master of Tu Ru Bong 3 could see the name of the large vessel and port of registry; Highny and Cheju.

The master of Tu Ru Bong 3 called Highny at channel 16, communicated damage and requested assistance. At the time, a crew of Highny replied “Wait! I will report to master”, but Highny speeded up in the course of 230°without further reply.

The master of Tu Ru Bong 3 called Highny repeatedly, starting the main engine to follow her for 15 minutes. Nevertheless, Highny speeded up further, while Tu Ru Bong 3 could not keep sailing due to flooding through the cracks of the port hull resulted from the collision.

Eventually, Tu Ru Bong 3 stopped the main engine to take measures against flooding and returned to Chongjin Port on 2 October.

The deflagration reached the oiler who at that time was on guard in the engine room and caused a fire. The oiler resulted in serious injuries, although he was able to leave by his own means and give notice. The crew closed openings and vents and fired the CO2 extinguishing system of the engine room. Subsequently the crew closed the fuel supply, thus stopping the main engine. After allowing a reasonable time for the extinguishing agent to take effect, the engine room was accessed warning that a water leak had been produced inside. Despite the attempts to find out its origin and proceed to water drainage, the flood could not be controlled and caused the sinking of the fishing vessel. The 35 members of the crew left the vessel in the ""panga"" (auxiliary craft), being rescued shortly afterwards by a fishing boat, that went to the port of Victoria. In the voyage they were transhipped to another fishing vessel of the same company as the sunk one, arriving at port during the afternoon of the 28th. The injured was transfered to a hospital on arrival in Victoria. CONCLUSIONS The investigation has allowed to know facts that point to underlying causes that either triggered the accident or could favor it to occur. Immediate Causes : 1) There was a deflagration in the engine room of the B / P CAMPOLIBRE ALAI as a result of the possible loosening or rupture of the fuel conduit of the injection pump of the cylinder # 6 of the main engine, at the height of the union with the cylinder head motor. This caused the nebulization of fuel under pressure and the formation of an explosive mixture of air and fuel that eventually ignited when it came into contact with a heat source, which in turn caused damage and a fire in the engine room. 2) Although the loosened or broken duct is not available for analysis it is reasonable to think, since the engine had not undergone any repair or recent adjustment, that a rupture could have occurred as a result of material fatigue, over-tightening, vibrations, etc. . (3) Due to the type and age of the ship, it was not required that the high pressure fuel lines be surrounded by containment devices. The high pressure fuel lines were not protected. Despite the age of the ship, simple containment measures, such as the use of aluminum tapes, could have been adopted, which CIAIM has confirmed that they were not used. Such belts would not prevent a tube from breaking, or that fuel would flow and pour over the engine, but would prevent or hinder the creation of an explosive mixture of air and fuel. 4) The engine did not have automatics and warning systems to react to an eventuality like the one that occurred with the injection pump of the cylinder number 6, getting to lower the engine speed and even, to stop it at the same time as alarms were shot on the event. 5) There was no prior warning that an explosive mixture of air and fuel was forming.There were no fire alarms before the deflagration occurred.If these alarms had sounded, the lookout personnel could have made decisions in advance.CIAIM can not know if fire detectors were installed, or their type; only knows that there were no detectors installed in the engine room on the ship's drawings. 6) If the oiler on duty, when he became aware of the break, had immediately stopped the engine (immediate action and for which no technical skill is required) would have stopped the process of creating the explosive mixture of air and fuel.This would not prevent the mixture that had already been created could explode, but would have reduced that possibility. 7) On the other hand, the oiler placed himself in grave danger by receiving on his body and on his clothes the fuel that came out under pressure of the pipe when trying to contain with a rag the fuel that went out under pressure. The risk materialized in damage when, in attempting to flee the engine room, the fire that had been generated after the deflagration burned the fuel on his body. 8) CIAIM can not determine the location, type, number and characteristics of the ""plastic"" pipes that replaced the corresponding cooling coils of the main engine and auxiliary engines of CAMPOLIBRE ALAI, although it assumes that the material constituting such pipes was not pyro-resistant and, therefore, was severely affected by the deflagration and subsequent fire. In addition, in view of the times in which the sinking took place, it assumes that this occurred by a water path of discrete flow, such as would occur by the breakage of one or several pipes of this type. Underlying Causes The foregoing considerations point to safety issues which are the underlying causes of the accident: 1) The ship, despite its size and basic characteristics in all cases assimilable to a merchant vessel, did not meet, as required by the regulations, latest safety enhancements to similar ships. 2) As a consequence of the above, the Company had not adhered to the best practices of control and maintenance of the engines and systems installed on board. 3) The CIAIM has no evidence that the modifications made to the refrigeration pipes were under the supervision of a competent technical agency, such as the Inspection of a Maritime Captaincy or a Classification Society. 4) The crew on duty was not able, or had no authority, to understand that the best solution in that case would have been to stop the engine immediately.","Fish Catching Vessel","Pollution,Serious injuries,Ship rendered unfit to proceed,Total loss of the ship","2214","Bureau Veritas (BV)","","","29","0","6","0","0","0","1","0","0","2019-11-19",""

At about 0745, while the crew (2 ABs, an OS, the bosun and electrician) was preparing the vessel for departure, by closing hatch covers and replacing grabs, one AB was helping to guide the grabs into position with a rope. He was standing on the forward hatch cover of cargo hold # 3 to replace the grab in its at-sea position. He apparently wasn’t aware that the aft hatch cover of cargo hold # 3 was not completely closed. While walking backwards, still guiding the grab, he fell into the cargo hold. Seconds before both the bosun, operating the crane, and the electrician, working nearby, shouted to warn the AB, but with the noise of the cranes, he didn’t hear them.
Immediately, the chief officer and master were notified and they went into cargo hold # 3 and found the AB without any vital signs. Paramedics were called and an ambulance arrived at about 0805. They took the AB to a local private hospital, arriving there about 0850, where he was pronounced dead.

The AB, although aware that the aft hatch cover was being closed, had climbed on the forward hatch cover to check that the grab, which had been lifted by the bosun using ship’s crane # 2, was properly placed on the top of the mast house. At that moment, the forward hatch cover at # 3 hatch was fully closed, but the aft hatch cover was still being closed. The electrician was disconnecting the electrical connections to the grab equipment and was standing on the main deck, port side.  The AB climbed on the forward # 3 hatch cover, using a small step ladder located on # 3 hatch coaming, on the port side forward.  He was properly dressed in a boiler-suit, with helmet, safety boots, safety belt, and he was equipped with a walkie-talkie.  

He stepped on to the hatch cover while looking aft about 7.5 meters over the # 3 forward hatch cover. Seconds later he walked backwards about 4 steps towards the end of the forward hatch cover while the aft hatch cover was still not completely closed, to ensure that the grab was properly resting on its securing points located on the top of the mast house. The bosun saw him stepping backwards, called him on his VHF radio, and even exited the cab of the crane and shouted to him, as did the electrician, but the AB did not hear them.

The ferry quickly started listing, and the captain decided to beach the vessel in a nearby bay. The six passengers were evacuated and transported back to Stokkasjøen on the ferry’s MOB boat. No passengers or crew members were physically injured during the incident.
The captain’s resolute action in a critical situation and decision to beach the vessel in a nearby bay, plus the fact that there were only six passengers on board, helped to limit the extent of the accident. 
The Accident Investigation Board Norway’s investigation shows that, for the last few minutes before it ran aground, ‘Godfjord’ was making a steady turn to port until the vessel hit Kalvhyllodden. Because the captain believed he had activated the autopilot and set course for Vågsodden, he focused his attention on the work orders lying on the chart table. The lookout had not come up to the bridge after departure. This meant that, in reality, no one was navigating or steering the ferry until it ran aground.

At the time, the vessel was about 60 nautical miles off Cabo Finisterre.
The crew responded and commenced fire-fighting with boundary cooling and the use of the water drenching system on board. Subsequently, the fixed CO2 system was used but due to a number of leaks in the CO2 line, the required amount of gas did not reach the cargo hold to be effective to smother the fire. The starboard fire main line then developed a large leak at a joint in the under deck passage way and had to be isolated. This restricted the fire-fighting efforts to only the port side, and rendered the starboard side water drenching system unusable.
Eventually, the crew members, were able to control and restrict the fire and subsequently, the vessel resumed her passage, although was instructed to head to Rotterdam, where she arrived safely on 10 September. The fire was finally extinguished on 14 September by the Port of Rotterdam’s fire brigade.
Barzan sustained minor structural damage in cargo hold no. 2. The CO2 system had to be inspected and overhauled and the starboard fire main line was adjusted and repaired.
The safety investigation concluded that although the CO2 system and fire mains had been tested satisfactorily prior to the vessel’s delivery in May 2015, the quality of the workmanship had contributed to the subsequent failure of both systems.","Container Ship","Ship remains fit to proceed","196536","[Other]","199744","Solid cargo - Containers","24","0","0","","","","","","","2017-01-03",""

The yacht was one of 12 identical yachts participating in the Race with a complement of a professional skipper and 21 fee-paying crew. Before the accident, the yacht had been sailing under its yankee 1 headsail and full mainsail on a broad starboard reach when, due to increasing winds the watch leader decided that it was necessary to reef the mainsail. He had stepped forward of the mainsheet traveller to brief the crew when the yacht altered course. This caused the wind to catch the leech of the mainsail putting the sail aback, causing tension on the preventer line. The forward strop securing the preventer line to the bow broke, releasing the boom, which then moved swiftly to starboard across the cockpit in an accidental and uncontrolled gybe. The yacht then performed a second uncontrolled gybe with the boom swinging back onto the port side before the helmsman was able to regain control. During the uncontrolled gybes, the watch leader sustained a fatal neck injury and, despite the efforts of his crew mates, could not be resuscitated. The cause of the unexpected and sudden movement of the yacht was the accidental gybes, during which the preventer securing strop failed. This strop had been constructed using high modulus polyethylene rope. An assessment of the preventer arrangement by the company had concluded that it was fit for purpose. The strengths of the preventer line, strop and pad-eye were estimated but not documented and no estimate of their expected in service loading had been recorded. Following the accident, actions taken by the company were aimed at improving crew safety on board the yachts, and included: the introduction of a second preventer line; the marking of the area to be avoided while running downwind, when an accidental gybe was possible; and, debriefing the crew with the lessons learned from the preventer strop failure.","Other Activities Ships","Loss of life","49.6","","","","","0","","1","0","0","0","0","0","2019-11-14",""

1.2   When crew members including the fitter were working on receiving provision stores from the pier, the hook of the hoist suddenly failed to response to the hoisting command from its remote controller. Two electricians (sign-on and sign-off electricians) were on board on that day and were summoned to look into the fault without any safety precautions being established among crew members. For unknown reasons, the fitter did not follow others and stood underneath the hoist. 
1.3   During the process of trouble shooting, the sign-on electrician hoisted up the hook by repeatedly pressing the “Up” button on a parking controller when the hook was about to enter the parking position inside the superstructure on the monorail. Suddenly, the hoist wire parted.
1.4   As a result, the hook dropped and knocked against the safety helmet of the fitter and then crushed the right ankle of the fitter before punching on the main deck. The fitter was seriously injured in unconscious state with serious bleeding. An ambulance was called by the master and the fitter was evacuated from the vessel to a local hospital. After surgery and intensive care, the fitter’s condition was stabilized and was improving.

Minor damage was caused to Daroja but damage to Erin Wood included breaches of the hull, resulting in flooding of the vessel and pollution from leaking fuel cargo. At the time of the accident, both vessels were manned by watchkeepers not keeping
a lookout and therefore unaware of the risk of collision. On board Daroja, the chief officer, who was the officer of the watch, missed opportunities to detect Erin Wood by visual, radar and automatic identification system means. This happened because he had become complacent through distraction, inattentiveness, the repetitive nature of the vessel’s schedule and insufficient supervision. On board Erin Wood, the bridge was not continuously manned and, although the skipper was aware of the presence of another vessel, the situation was not effectively assessed and an assumption was made that a larger ship would keep clear. Lone watchkeeping was a causal factor on board both vessels and, similar to previous MAIB investigations, this report highlights the importance of identifying and managing risks when a sole watchkeeper is the only lookout. This investigation has also identified significant safety shortcomings in the management and operation of Erin Wood. The vessel’s crew did not have the competence necessary to operate a small tanker and there was not an effective safety management system. This unsafe situation arose because Erin Wood’s managing company lacked experience in the industry sector and prioritised commercial gain ahead of safety at sea. Risks associated with Erin Wood’s operations also went undetected by the flag and coastal states. This happened because the Flag State’s process of initial registration was not sufficiently thorough and because Erin Wood was not inspected under the Port State Control regime. United Shipping Companies Barnkrug GmbH & Co.KG, Daroja’s managing company, has reviewed its safety management system and made a series of changes to improve bridge watchkeeping standards. Northern Oils Limited, Erin Wood’s managing company, has temporarily ceased transportation of fuel products by sea. Nevertheless, safety recommendations have been made to both managing companies intended to improve
standards of navigation and watchkeeping. A safety recommendation has also been made to the St Kitts and Nevis International Ship Registry intended to improve its assessment of potential risks during the process of initial registration of vessels being taken onto its flag.","General Cargo Ship","","3266","","4155","","","","","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","2017-05-09","2018-12-03"

As the ship was passing between Great and Little Saltee, it became swamped and capsized. All of the ships ‘occupant except one (who remained in the water throughout) managed to climb onto the upturned hull and remained there until they were rescued. No attempt was made to right the ship.

The system was in ""nomal"" mode.Once outside the pier, the control was transferred from stbd wing to wheelhouse. Then the Master realised thet the system was not functioning so he decided immediately to transfer again the control to stbd wing. The system remained out of order, in the mode ""normal"". Captain decided to stop the 4 motors and lower the anchor as the ship was not much underway and he judged that there was room to stop the vessel. The vessel slowed down until she was completely stopped by hitting with her starboard hull stem against the Northern Breakwater, producing a small indent of 400 mm just on the fore end of the starboard hull. No water ingress was produced. Further inspection of the area by Class Society and Capitana did not show heavy but minor damages so the vessel was let operate normally. Further inspection of system points to a thermal relay protection of PIME motor going off just in the moment when the system control was being transferred from wing to wheelhouse. That caused the immediate failure of the ""nomal"" mode operation of the LIPS system. The crew did not realise at that moment that they could by-pass the ""normal"" mode and change to a ""backup"" mode. Such backup mode would permit the manual operation of the system. Further investigation of the LIPS SYSTEM found that the control console's power source underwent a fluctuating brown out bigger than 50%, resulting in an increased electric intensity and the shot of the dedicated protection relay. The brown out was being caused by the poor contact of electric terminals in the circuit, so problem was solved tightening all terminals affected. CONCLUSIONS The immediate cause of the accident was the drop in supply voltage fluctuating for over 50% of the control system of LIPS. The voltage drop was due to defective connections, as the terminals had loosened, of the components of the power supply to the control system LIPS.The CIAIM considers that the actions of the captain in this case by ordering the engine shut down was enough to avoid collision with the M/V BENZU, given its proximity, but it probably would have been better to order directly a ""crash stop"" or disengaging the engines rather than stopping them, as it would have avoided the problem that the engines woull not start later and that way the ship would not had been defenceless and hit the dock.","Passenger / Ro-Ro Cargo Ship","Ship rendered unfit to proceed","4112","RINA Services S.p.A (RINA)","","Roll-on/Roll-off","33","108","","","","","","","","2019-10-25",""

The shipwreck was never recovered due to the great sea depth at the foundering position. From the information provided during the investigation process, a massive water ingress in the engine room resulted to the vessel being capsized and finally sank.

However the recovery attempt was unsuccessful and the fishermen sunk out of view approximately 10 minutes later. Despite a search involving numerous vessels and a helicopter, co-ordinated by the RNLI lifeboat on scene, his body was not recovered.
The accident occurred when a rope stopper used to hold back the wire trawl warp that had been paid out over the stern of the vessel, failed, and because the crewman was standing in an unsafe position in the bight of the warp. As a result of the stopper failure, the warp suddenly became taught, catching him around the chest, and throwing him violently backwards over the side of the vessel.

The deceased man, Nick Perrin, had been employed by Oldenburg’s owner, the Lundy Company Limited, as a shore-based rope handler and had gone on board the vessel to socialise with the crew before its departure from Ilfracombe.
Oldenburg was alongside the Outer Face berth, which was close to the harbour entrance and, after Nick had boarded, the vessel’s gangway had been withdrawn due to the vessel’s movement in the prevailing moderate swell.
The accident occurred as Nick attempted to return ashore by walking through a main deck shell door, which had been left open and unguarded, and along the vessel’s external belting to a platform and steps on the quayside. The vessel’s crew were not aware that Nick had intended to return ashore at that time or by that route, as no-one had previously attempted to do so.
Following the accident the crew went to Nick’s aid but, due to his injuries, they were unable to recover him onto the vessel and he was lowered into the water to facilitate his retrieval by a lifeboat. Tragically, Nick died of his injuries shortly after arriving at a local hospital.
The vessel’s owner undertook an internal investigation of the accident and has fitted barriers and signage to the vessel’s shell door openings to prevent unauthorised use.

himself to the risk of falling overboard. Presumably, he did not don a harness and fall arrester, because the risk of falling was not apparent to the 3rd officer as he was still behind the guard 
rail.
The company has notified DMAIB about several preventive measures that have been implemented after the accident.","Liquefied Gas Tanker","Loss of life","11711","","","","16","0","0","1","","","","","","2016-01-20",""

As the bridal gear came up, one of the hooks’ extension ‘beak’ snagged on the underside of the OVLS door.
The bridal gear momentarily came under tension until the extension ‘beak’ broke away from the hook and the entire bridal rigging was instantly freed with tremendous force. At the time, the lead rigger was standing at the edge of the OVLS door, looking down into the moon pool (Figure 5). The bridal gear flung outward and struck the lead rigger’s left arm.
The riser pre-installation operations were immediately stopped and the ship’s medic was called to attend and treat the lead rigger. The medic examined the injured rigger and found fracture of the Ulna and Radius bones of the left arm. The lead rigger was subsequently evacuated ashore by helicopter for urgent medical treatment.","Other Activities Ships","Serious injuries","15701","[Other]","9300","","101","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","2016-07-26",""

Upon arrival, the vessel carried out the normal procedural checks for cargo discharge operations, which started on 20 July 2015. Cargo discharge and a follow up ‘Commercial Wash’ were completed at 2300 on 20 July 2015, followed with the disposal of cargo tank washing water to slops tanks ashore. On completion of the Commercial Wash and receiving an empty cargo tank certificate, the vessel embarked a pilot at 0200 (21 July 2015) and proceeded to Botlek Lay-by Buoy No. 61, arriving and declaring all fast at 0400.
At 0500 on 20 July, the vessel commenced cleaning procedures in preparation for the loading of the next cargo – gasoil. The cleaning operations were completed at 0830 before commencing the ventilation procedures. In order to ensure that all traces of the previous cargo had been removed, the crew members had to access the cargo tanks to remove any final cargo residues, using an air driven pump. At about 1130, atmosphere monitoring was carried out and recorded as being safe for the cargo tank entry. Four crew members were detailed to carry out these final cleaning checks and to enter the cargo tanks under the enclosed space permit-to-work procedures.
During the afternoon, two crew members started feeling unwell and had to be attended by the other crew members. Oxygen was also administered. Eventually, the master contacted the agent to request shore medical assistance. By 2000, the injured parties had been disembarked and transferred to a local hospital. Other crew members visited the hospital for precautionary checks, but were subsequently cleared to return to the vessel.
Subsequent attendance by port State Control resulted in the vessel attracting two Code 17 deficiencies under Code 04118 – Enclosed space entry and rescue drills, a general heading of ‘Lack of training’ in accordance with SOLAS Chapter III – 19.3.6.2 and Code 15150 – ISM under ISM regulation 1.2.2.2. The vessel was also detained.
The MSIU found that the immediate cause of the accident was intoxication due to contact with Aniline, either through the skin and / or by inhalation of the cargo vapour.","Bulk Dry / Oil Carrier","Serious injuries","4808","Bureau Veritas (BV)","7003","","17","0","0","0","0","0","7","0","0","2016-07-14",""

Just before the pilotage line, the pilot left the vessel and the master, who was alone on the bridge with the helmsman, discovered that STENA JUTLANDICA was closing faster than he had anticipated. He then proposed that the vessels should pass starboard to starboard. STENA JUTLANDICA, which was on its way in from Fredrikshavn, had already begun a slight turn to port ahead of TERNVIND in order to position herself in the fairway. As a result of a misunderstanding in the radio communications between the vessels, those in command of the vessels developed different understandings of how the meeting would be conducted. The master of TERNVIND got the impression that it had been agreed that they would pass starboard to starboard. However, on STENA JUTLANDICA, the officer intended to have the vessels to pass port to port. As TERNVIND was turning to port in order to, as the crew believed, provide more space for STENA JUTLANDICA, a collision occurred. In summary, SHK is of the opinion that the accident was caused by improper planning of the vessels meeting, combined with a misunderstanding in the communication concerning this meeting. Together, both vessels respective turn to port also constituted a prerequisite for the collision to take place. SHK is also of the opinion that inadequate lookout on TERNVIND and the pilotage ending too early probably constituted contributory causes of the accident. Another contributory cause may have been that the officers of the watch on the vessels probably were affected by fatigue. In terms of raising the alarm, SHK concludes that internal reporting within Stena Line was prioritised ahead of reporting to the public rescue services. Nevertheless, the investigation has shown that in this respect the crew acted in accordance with the internal check-list for collisions that is in force within the shipping company. As an evacuation of a passenger vessel of STENA JUTLANDICA's size requires advance planning and preparation, SHK is of the opinion that there are grounds for Stena Line to revise the vessels procedures, and those of the shipping company, with regard to what priority contact with the JRCC is to have. With respect to the public rescue services, SHK is of the opinion that the JRCC should have classed the event as more serious than they did, and in the absence of an alarm from the vessel, should have taken the initiative to obtain more information about the event.","Passenger / Ro-Ro Cargo Ship","Ship rendered unfit to proceed","29691","Lloyd's Register (LR)","","Other cargo","89","531","","","","","","","","2020-12-09",""

	The Panama registered bulk carrier HIRAM sailed from the Port of Bintulu, Malaysia on the 9th July 2015, destined to the Port of Kandla, India.
	The vessel was fully loaded with logs on holds and on deck.
	During the voyage the vessel received instructions to stop at Singapore to take bunkers and provisions.
        On the 12th July 2015 after midnight the vessel arrived to anchorage off the TSS Singapore and dropped anchor.
	Within a short time after arrival, the vessel started to take bunkers and thereafter the crew continued with their normal duties waiting for the provisions to come.
        Around 18.00 hrs the Chief Officer gave instructions to the Carpenter to take soundings on all cargo hold bilges.
	Meantime at 19, 00 hours while the Chief Officer was on the bridge, the high level alarm sounded and indicated water on hold no. 2
	Chief Officer asked the Carpenter to take once again soundings on hold no. 1 and hold no. 2


	At that time the Chief Officer left the bridge and went down to investigate what was going on. The 2nd Officer was left on the bridge on duty.

	The Master was immediately advised and together with the bosun, all went to hold no. 2

	After a while one OS went to the hold no. 2 entrance to look for the Bosun. 

	The OS observed the aft entrance hatch to hold no. 2 open and called the Bosun. In view that there was no reply from the inside of the hold, the OS called the Carpenter to help him.

	On arrival the Carpenter noticed from the hatch three bodies lying unconscious on the ladder and the platform inside the cargo hold. 

	The OS called the bridge immediately and asked for assistance while the Carpenter stood at the hold entrance waiting for the rescue team to arrive.

	Rescue team arrived with two (2) sets of EEBD.

	During the first attempt to enter and rescue the first body, one of the EEBDs lost all the air pressure and the other was pulled from the AB´s face.

	Immediately both AB managed to leave the hold. 

	At that time the breathing apparatus were donned and rescue of the three bodies was carried out 

	During the rescue the BA masks were pulled off the AB´s face. One of them lost consciousness at arrival to the entrance but grabbed by the 2nd Officer and the Chief Engineer.

	Master, Chief Officer and Bosun were rescued with no signs of breathing and pulse.

	Two (2) AB were brought to deck unconscious or semi unconscious with difficulty breathing. 

	At around 20,00 hrs the 3rd Officer went to the bridge to call for assistance to shore.

	The Malaysian Maritime Enforcement (MME) Agency responded to the call and arrived onboard around 23.30 hrs.

	At that time the MME Officers declared the Master, Chief Officer and Bosun as dead.

	By 01.30 hrs the two injured AB were disembarked and taken to Hospital.

	This report analyses the events and the possible causes of this multiple fatality accident when entering a cargo hold which apparently was not foreseen as a dangerous enclosed space.

	A number of other accidents are described and compared trying to highlight the importance of procedures and training to be followed when entering enclosed spaces.

	The IMO adopted on the 20th December 2011 revised recommendations for entering enclosed spaces onboard ships under resolution A.1050(27).

	On the 21st June 2013 the IMO highlighted the need for drills for enclosed space and added such drill requirement in SOLAS.

The vessel had departed the Port of Jakarta, Indonesia following discharge operations. The vessel was then then loaded with the following dangerous goods (DG) containers. The vessel navigated through adverse weather due to tropical cyclone (Chan-hom); approximately 400 km west of the Japanese island of Kuchinoshima. The Master was on the Bridge, and he described hearing an ‘explosion’ and observing a white/yellow deposit on the Bridge window, followed by fire on the starboard side of Bay 22 (Forward end of Hold 4). The crew mustered and proceeded to fight the fire. The Japanese coastguard was called to assist with the fire-fighting efforts; they arrived a short time thereafter. On 12 July, salvers boarded the vessel to assist in extinguishing the fire. The fire was eventually brought under control on or around 13 July.

The Master and crew on board were of Philippines nationality.

The vessel arrived at pilot boarding ground of Surabaya port on 28th June 2015 at 2000hrs and awaited river transit. Pilot boarded the vessel at 2236 hrs and vessel transited through Surabaya port river channel. The navigation bridge was manned by the Master, Duty Officer (3rd Officer), Duty AB and the Pilot.

Third officer was engaged in executing the Pilot’s instructions with regard to advised course and engine movements as well as plotting positions on the chart. The duty AB was on manual hand steering, attending the helm orders of Pilot.

The Echo Sounder alarm was set for 1.5 meter under keel clearance. The weather experienced was south westerly wind of force 2 on the Beaufort scale and low swell. The current was from SW direction at about 2 knots.  

After 10mins of pilot boarding, the vessel passed buoy no. 7 and over took a vessel on her starboard side. After over taking a vessel the pilot communicated with another vessel which was outbound. Both ships safely passed each other starboard to starboard. 

Short while later while passing Jamunag Island, the speed was reduced to half ahead and then again resumed full ahead.

At 2300hrs, The MV “Leo Perdana” pilot called another outbound vessel LPG Tanker MT “Navigator Aries” on VHF. After establishing VHF communication, both vessels agreed to pass each other Port to Port. After about 10mins, the vessel MV “Leo Perdana” passed buoy no. 11 and changed heading to 215 º to pass clear of a tugboat “Transform” on her own starboard side. 

After safely passing the tug, pilot again called ""Navigator Aries” on VHF for re-confirming to pass port to port. Following this communication he advised duty AB to bring the ship’s heading to 225º. The MV “Leo Perdana” turned to starboard but suddenly her head started swinging towards the port side while the rudder was still hard to starboard. The duty AB was trying to steady the ship on course advised by the pilot with engines going full ahead but the vessel did not respond well.

At 2317hrs, The MV “Leo Perdana” seeing that MT “Navigator Aries” was in a very close quarter situation, stopped her engine and put engines on full astern. Since the steering was found to be sluggish and ineffective, she called the M.T. “Navigator Aires” and informed about her maneuvering difficulty
                   

Leo Perdana still having head momentum and could not stop or pass clear of tanker ""Navigation Aries"". At 2318hrs both ships collided with Leo Perdana making contact on the port side of her hull forward of her bridge.

The collision occurred 20 nautical miles off Surabaya, in the vicinity of Karang Jamuang Island, Indonesia.

After the collision, MV “Leo Perdana” immediately sounded the emergency alarm and made announcements on the public address system. 

The pilot called for assistance stating that the tanker MT “Navigator Aries” was on fire after the collision. The MV “Leo Perdana” continued to go full astern on the engine and was trying to pull away clear from MT “Navigator Aries”  because she (MV “Leo Perdana”) had Dangerous cargo on board stowed in her forward section.  

Four tugs were dispatched to the scene of the accident and towed MT “Navigator Aries” to anchorage to a position 10 nautical miles off Gresik Island. 

The container ship MV “Leo Perdana” proceeded to Surabaya port under her own power and berthed at 0338hrs on 29th June 2015 for subsequent repairs and inspections.
During the collision, there were no injuries or casualties, but both ships sustained serious hull and machinery damages.

A passenger vehicle was damaged due to the collision. The ferry sustained large indentations above the waterline in the bow section. The hull sustained a minor tear in this area. Moreover, a twin dolphin broke apart and the quay facility sustained minor damage due to the collision.
The ferry was usually manoeuvred using her two Schottel propellers. This was also the case during the third call at the port of Norddeich on that day. The cause of the collision was that the captain apparently only half-pressed a push button used for switching from autopilot to the manual control system for the Schottel propellers. Due to the switching characteristics of the push button, which had not been identified up until that point, the half-pressed push button did not cause the control system to switch completely, even though this was indicated visually. As a result, it was not possible for the captain to execute a planned turning and deceleration manoeuvre within the inner harbour. When the risk of colliding with the quay facility was recognised, the captain attempted to decelerate the ferry using her conventional propeller and warn the passengers. This was only partially successful. The ferry collided with the quay at a speed of about 5 kts.","Passenger / Ro-Ro Cargo Ship","Serious injuries,Ship remains fit to proceed","1007","[Other]","220","Solid cargo - Roll-on/Roll-off","12","187","0","0","0","0","0","8","0","2018-01-11",""

Loads of various types of fertilizer were on board the multi-purpose carrier in the lower holds of cargo holds 2 to 5, which were loaded in Antwerp. In addition, various types of general cargo were stowed in cargo hold 1 and in the tween decks of cargo holds 3 and 4. Since the River Weser was closed due to a separate incident, the ship's command opted for an anchorage in the deep water roadstead on the German Bight. During the anchor manoeuvre, the master noticed smoke in the area of cargo hold 3 from his position on the bridge. An initial survey of the scene was carried out during the anchor manoeuvre. Some time later, an individual wearing breathing apparatus attempted to investigate cargo hold 3. This attempt was aborted due to the dense smoke rising from the cargo hold entrance hatch (booby hatch). The ships command had realised, that the smoke generation was possibly connected with the cargo of fertilizer in the lower hold of cargo hold 3 After consultation with the ships management, the ship's command decided to use CO2 as an extinguishing agent. The Weser pilots were notified of the events on board as the first contact point ashore 2.5 hours after the CO2 was discharged. Later on, Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) Bremerhaven issued a prohibition on entry, which was to be maintained until the situation on board was clarified. Since a fact-finding team (FFT) from the fire service was required for the inspection on board, VTS Wilhelmshaven contacted the German Central Command for Maritime Emergencies (CCME) with a request that it assume overall command of the operation, which happened at 0259 on 26 May 2015[1]. The first team from Cuxhaven Fire Service reached the PURPLE BEACH on a federal police helicopter at about 0500. The firefighters established that the ammonium nitrate-containing fertilizer on board decomposed. With regard to an assessment about the development of the reaction rate, the fire department could only make an approximation. Therefore, the vessel was not considered a safe platform anymore. This led to the decision to evacuate the vessel. When the firefighters left the vessel a massive outbreak of smoke developed, which together with the readings made was indicative of an imminent explosion. All the firefighters left the ship as the situation unfolded. The ship's command of the PURPLE BEACH was advised to abandon the ship as well. The crew complied with this and abandoned the ship on a free-fall lifeboat. The nearby MELLUM took the crew of the PURPLE BEACH on board. Due to the exposure of the crew of the PURPLE BEACH, the firefighters, and some of the MELLUM's crew members, these individuals were all decontaminated, examined, and later flown to various hospitals as a precaution. The ships MELLUM, NEUWERK und NORDIC were ordered to the scene and were later tasked with cooling the distressed vessel and suppressing the cloud of smoke. The assumption at this point was that an exothermal self-sustaining decomposition of ammonium nitrate based fertilizer had occurred in hold 3 and was ongoing. The deployed units managed to flood cargo hold 3 of the ship with water over the next few days, thus stopping the reaction. The ship was then towed to a place of refuge in Wilhelmshaven, which is also where the BSU began its investigations on board the ship. For the actual unloading operations and the disposal of discharged water, the PURPLE BEACH later shifted to another berth in Wilhelmshaven, where the unloading of the ship was completed in July 2016. The towing operation to Turkey, where the ship was destined for scrapping, began in March 2017. The marine casualty did not give rise to any fatalities or serious injuries. The BSU was not made aware of any water pollution.

The vessel QI YUAN arrived at Kutubdia roads of Chittagong port at 02:37 am (LT) on 20th May 2015 from Vietnam loaded with 43,998 MetricTons of “cement clinker” in bulk at a draft of 11.10 meters (Forward and Aft), even keel, and was awaiting for next high tide to shift to Chittagong outer anchorage.

As per cargo stowage plan, 19,998 MetricTons of cargo was nominated for the discharging at Chittagong and the remaining 24,000 Metric Tons were supposed to be discharged at Mongla, Bangladesh.

However, vessel QI YUAN commenced shifting from Kutubdia roads (anchorage) towards Chittagong outer anchorage at about 10:50 are LT on 20 May 2015. The vessel entered in Alpha anchorage area of Chittagong outer roads at 01:35 pm LT on the same day. For the desired anchor position, the vessel “QI YUAN” was maneuvering northerly on a heading 339ᴼ (T) along the coastline.  During this high tide since the current was flowing to north during high tides, every vessel anchored in Chittagong outer anchorage were seen to be facing southerly. 

From the records, at 01:48 pm, vessel QI YUAN was in position 22°15.75 N and 091°44.47 E, maintaining her course 339ᴼ (T) at speed of 5 knots while the vessel HAKO was nearing a nautical mile away. However, the later vessel HAKO was anchored in position 22°16.59 N and 091°44.0 E in Chittagong ALPHA anchorage and making no way through water.

In order to proceed to the desired anchor position, at 01:52 pm, in position 22°16.11 N and 091°44.51 E while the vessel HAKO (anchored, heading south and making no way through water) was 0.5 ~ 0.6 nautical miles away, the vessel QI YUAN altered course to port from 339ᴼ to 310ᴼ (T) with an intention to cross target (mv. HAKO) from her bow. At this stage, the engines of QI YUAN were running in dead slow ahead.

Since the vessel was put on port helm against the current, her turning to port was a bit slow. Further, strong tidal effect caused her drifting quickly towards the vessel HAKO. Within a minute, it was observed that the distance between two vessels was closing sharply. At 01:54 pm when Master of “QI YUAN” realized that CPA is becoming dangerously close, he then stopped engines (01:54 pm) and within few seconds he ordered engines on dead slow astern, then half astern and finally full astern. These quick engine movements from stop to full astern were seen to be executed from 01:54 pm to 01:55 pm when he realized that a collision is likely to happen. (timings are supported by Deck and Engine bell book, attached herewith). 

At 01:56 pm in position 22°16.68 N and 091°44.26 E, while the vessel QI YUAN was nearing only 0.27 nautical miles, mv. HAKO was continuously blowing horn. But it was too late for QI YUAN to control her movement and speed even with her main engine on full astern and eventually she dragged herself on HAKO which was anchored in position 22°16.59 N and 091°44.0 E. 

At 01:58 pm (LT) on 20 May 2015, the vessel QI YUAN collided with the vessel HAKO in way of cargo hold No.1 forward and aft of forecastle store in position 22°16.59 N and 091°44.0 E in Chittagong ALPHA anchorage at speed of 1.0 knot with the main engines running with “full astern”. 

Just after couple of minutes (1~2 minutes), mv. QI YUAN cleared herself from the vessel HAKO by her engines running with full astern and proceeded in position at 22°17.36 N and 091°44.24 E where at 02:23 pm on 20 May 2015 finally dropped anchor.

The crew were rescued by the rescue helicopter (H / S) FISHING I, the Xunta de Galicia and the E / P ESTELA, who was fishing nearby. CONCLUSIONS The accident was caused by the upset caused by the breaking waves, which approached the ship for its starboard bow. The area that was fishing the E / P NEW VANESA favors the sudden formation of waves that can change direction, so it is essential to be extremely vigilant of the sea state, monitoring was not effective in this case.

PRIDE"", in ballast condition with draft forward 6.6 meters and aft 8.3 meters sailed from Boryoung, South Korea bound for Newcastle, Australia on 4th May 2015, when/where two(2) persons of maintenance team, such as Mr. Yoon Seoung Cheol & Mr. Myung Bo Il, joined on board as request of the ship's managing company.

The two (2) persons as supernumerary embarked on board in order to carry out repair works during one voyage (Boryeong, S. Korea → Newcastle, Australia → Boryeong, S. Korea) for some parts which made conclusion with company's superintendent in every day. They have been discussed with superintendent by e-mail and fixed a daily works.

Subsequent dates, at sea on 14th May 2015, the vessel proceeded heading to Australia with good weather, smooth to slight sea with light wind & good visibility, in speed of 11.0 knots. The day's works were conducted as normal condition and Mr. Yoon is a leader for maintenance works at this voyage. 

At 1245 hours on 14th May, they met with C/O for after noon works and 1310 hours, Mr. Yoon instructed OS to transfer one of stools to the port side near the pilot combination ladder and talked to co-worker Mr. Myung that he would check out some stanchion sockets for the pilot combination ladder, and at 1315 hours one OS (B) saw Mr. Yoon walked toward forecastle deck when OS put a stool on port side near the pilot combination ladder. 

No body saw Mr. Yoon since that time of 1315 hours on same date and Mr. Myung with OS in way of working on deck did not try to look for Mr. Yoon because it was deemed he had been making some investigation of inside cargo holds & other worn parts as a matter of course.

At 1630 hours on same date, Mr. Myung reported to bridge team because Mr. Yoon was not seen for a while and immediately Master was told of this situation, Master instructed to all crew members that they should search all over the vessel to find him, but he was not found anywhere on board the vessel. 

At 1715 hours on same date, Master filed a report on this situation to the ship's owner and turned her course back to previous course lines with sharp lookout at sea and subsequently arriving at the area where he was deemed to get missing, all crew members initiated making search for him from 2145 hours on 14th May to 1200 hours on 18th May between position Lat. 00-53.8S & Long. 145-02.1E and position Lat.01-04.9 & Long. 145-50.8E. Despite all crew members' searching efforts, failure to find him resulted and being forced give up searching for him as per the owner's instruction at 1200 hours on 18th May and the vessel resumed her course of passage plan to Newcastle, Australia.

.2	The vessel delayed the voyage schedule to wait for spare casing in anchorage (23°21N and 116°43E) on 13 May 2015 at about 2045 hours. On 14 May 2015 when a launch boat came alongside to deliver the spare casing, the lifting work by one manual hoist and one electric hoist commenced until it was moved to the aft of the “Boat Deck” directly above the engine room hatch on poop deck. At about 0930 when the electric hoist was used to lower down the spare casing at 7° from vertical through the hatch opening, the spare casing stuck in the hatch. A fitter used both of his sweaty hands to shake the hoist trying to free the spare casing. He suffered electrocution suddenly.  He was rescued and oxygen resuscitated by the other crew members. 
.3	At about 1015 hours, a rescue boat came and sent the fitter to a hospital at shore. However, he was declared dead in the hospital on the same day.

MV Star Craft 9 was on course 185°T, at a speed of 8 knots going to 10 knots, off the entrance of Mactan Channel when she observes a cargo vessel at her Starboard side identified as MV “Lady of Faith”. Likwewise, the Cargo Ship sighted a passenger ferry while approaching Lauis Ledge at full speed. the Master of M/V Our Lady of Faith tried to establish contact with MV Star Craft 9 via VHF radio advising the subject vessel to through her stern.

The Master M/V Starcraft 9 observes that MV Lady of Faith was on her starboard side and was trying to cross her bow and tried to slack her speed from 12 knots to 8 knots, vessel course was 180°T. she also noticed that MV Lady of Faith was calling through VHF Radio but failed to answer the radio.  The Master ordered the helmsman on duty  to alter her course to hard Starboard from 185°T to 195°T at a speed of 8 knots. He then ordered hard starboard as an evasive action in order to avoid collision.  the Master ordered to reduce speed but the ship’s steering did not respond and ordered to stop engine.

The starboard  bow of MV Star Craft 9 collided with forward of MV Lady of Faith in the position Latitude 010° 12.50N, Long 123°53.26E. Despite the actions taken by both vessels, the inertia cause by the ships momentum and the swells being generated have pushed MV Star Craft 9 to hit the portside bow of MV Lady of Hope.

The accident caused considerable raking damage to the hull and rendered the port propeller, shaft and rudder unserviceable.  There were no injuries and the vessel continued on its passage to Tobermory.
the investigation found that, having been unable to enter Tobermory Bay on arrival, the passage plan was not re-evaluated or amended. Combined with poor bridge team management and navigational practices, this resulted in the vessel running into danger and grounding.  Despite the loud noise and vibration resulting from the grounding, the bridge team did not initiate the post-grounding checklist, no musters were held and neither the vessel's managers nor any shore authorities were notified of the accident.
Upon arrival at Tobermory Bay, the master made an ill-considered and poorly executed attempt at anchoring just within the bay's entrance instead of the planned position in the south of the bay.  This had to be aborted to avoid to avoid a second grounding when Hamburg dragged its anchor.  The passenger vessel was then taken back out to the open sea with unknown damage to its structure, before diverting to Belfast where a dive survey revealed the extent of the damage. the vessel was withdrawn from service for 3 months for repairs.","Passenger/Cruise","Ship rendered unfit to proceed","15067","DNV GL AS (DNVGL)","1378","","164","297","","","","","","","","2017-04-03",""

He poured cooking oil inside a pot and left it on the gas stove.Since the flame was low the skipper headed on the stern to check the navigation.During that time he noticed that the shackle holding the fastening rope of the inflatable tender, was not secured and there was a risk for the tender to be released from its stowing position. He immediately stopped the engine and tried to secure the loose shackle. At that time he was sure that there was enough time to secure the tender before the cooking oil had reached the required temperature. When the shackle was secured he realized that smoke was coming out from the accommodation superstructure.He tried to suppress the fire using the portable fire extinguishers, but his efforts were unsuccessful due to the fact that the fire spread rapidly to all accommodation spaces.In a last attempt to save his life he jumped overboard, and he was later recovered from another yacht sailing in the nearby area.

• No installation guidance was provided with the crane as none was required by the applicable regulations.
• The number and size of the lock nuts, bolts and washers supplied by the manufacturer to secure the crane to the vessel’s deck, and the torque to which they were tightened, were not in accordance with the crane manufacturer’s installation specifications.
• The lock nuts used were of inferior material grade to that indicated by their markings.
• The quality control and quality assurance procedures in place at the suppliers did not prevent the use of an undersize mounting kit or the lower grade lock nuts.
• The thorough examination and testing of the crane following its installation did not identify the inadequacy of the crane’s mounting arrangement.

Karen’s crew managed to release both winch brakes, freeing the trawl warps; the starboard warp ran out completely but the
port warp became fouled on the winch drum, causing Karen to heel heavily to port and its stern to be pulled underwater. Karen broke free from the submarine when the port warp parted; there was structural damage to the vessel but it returned to Ardglass safely under its own power. Evidence of the collision on board the submarine was either not observed or misinterpreted. This meant that the submarine did not render immediate assistance as the

Whilst transporting, resuscitation was on-going on the aft deck. As the vessel rounded a tip of an island to pass through a narrow channel, a light was seen in the dark, seeming to be in the middle of the channel. The helmsman hesitated in performing the turn instructed by the master, causing a delay that together with lack of speed reduction, resulted in the vessel stranding at the speed of almost 30 knots. The light was shown to be navigation lights from a pilot boat, asked by JRCC to be in the area to show the way to the ambulance. This was not known on OWII. The stranding was caused by lack of forward planning on OWII, combined with too much speed. Furthermore, the surprise of finding a light in the channel into which OWII was heading led to hesitation in decision-making and to a delay in completing the turn. The speed was such that the room for action was limited and time for preventing the stranding was short. An increasing wind deviation aggravated the situation even more. Preconditions for the stranding to occur were that the pilot boat was placed there without OWII's knowledge. If the ECS on OWII had been differently set or if the radar screen had been better watched, the pilot boat could have been discovered earlier and the room of action increased. Contributing was likely that the crew didn't have enough education and training in high speed navigation, suitable for this type of activity, to ensure navigational forward planning. Safety recommendations As the Swedish Maritime Administration, responsible for JRCC, has taken actions to ensure that essential information for a safe SAR-operation is forwarded to anyone concerned, no recommendation is issued in that matter. The Swedish Sea Rescue Society is recommended to, in addition to already taken actions, consider to ensure that all masters, navigators and helmsmen experience the education in navigation, specially formed by the Society, or undergo an equivalent training.

The unknown object was later identified as the platform SPD13A which had reportedly been in that position for over a year preceding the incident. The platform was installed under the jurisdiction of the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
The electronic chart in use and the official British Admiralty (BA) chart did not indicate the presence of the platform. The platform reportedly was provided with warning lights to indicate its presence, which was reportedly not clearly seen by the bridge team. 
The platform was observed on the radar but thought to be a fishing vessel, which was expected to clear from the path of the tanker. Prior to the collision, the OOW was involved in a non-navigation related task that took his attention away from his primary responsibility. The contact resulted in structural damage to the vessel’s bow and to the platform. The vessel remained in stable condition after the collision and there were no injuries to any person or pollution from the incident. 
Investigations revealed that all machineries and navigation equipment were in good working order prior to the incident.
The primary cause of the incident was inadequacy in watchkeeping of the bridge team that failed to make use of all available resources in keeping a safe navigational watch. The presence of an uncharted oil platform and the lack of adequate promulgation of navigation warnings, prior to the incident, including the updating of charts with navigationally significant information were contributory.

ASIAN BREEZE had ordered two tugboats due to the ship's bow thruster being out of order. The ship would normally use just one tugboat connected at the aft.When the pilot came on board ASIAN BREEZE, the ship had a speed of 7-8 knots. The pilot immediately requested a stop of the engine and then astern in order to reduce the speed and connect the tugboats before the ship came too far into fairway. It was not until this stage that the pilot received the information that the bow thruster was not functioning. The pilot knew in advance that two tugboats had been ordered instead of the normal one, but he assumed that this was due to the strong winds earlier that day.SVITZER BJ RN was connected to the stern, after which the connection of BONDEN forward commenced. However, the vessel was soon running short on time as ASIAN BREEZE had begun to approach the harbour entrance. The pilot therefore announced that ASIAN BREEZE would complete a full turn to starboard in order to gain time. BONDEN was connected during the turn, but was forced at an early stage to perform an emergency release of the towline. BONDEN, which was to retrieve the released towline hanging from the central fairlead of the car carrier, proceeded to manoeuvre in close and beneath the bow of ASIAN BREEZE. At the same time, the pilot interrupted the starboard turn and commenced a turn to port instead, which was not perceived by BONDEN. At this point, the tugboat was subject to a sudden and involuntary turn to starboard, which was likely caused by the interaction between the two vessels. The tug master initiated full speed ahead and hard starboard rudder in an attempt to avoid a collision. BONDEN nevertheless collided with ASIAN BREEZE, whose bulbous bow made contact with the ship to stern and the propeller of BONDEN. The tugboat's main engine stopped and BONDEN proceeded to drift along ASIAN BREEZE's starboard side.","Towing / Pushing Tug","Ship rendered unfit to proceed","357","Lloyd's Register (LR)","","","3","","","","","","","","","2020-12-09",""

The crew had finished mooring and a draft surveyor was on board from the facility.
During a conversation he had with the C/O, the draft surveyor mentioned that samples of the cargo (steaming coal) had to be taken for the chartering company.
Probably due to a misinterpretation, after a conversation the C/O had with the bosun, an A/B and an O/S were sent by the bosun to get the samples from inside the cargo holds, by entering from their respective manholes. It should be noted that the cargo hold covers had not been opened yet.
When entering the cargo hold No 3 from the manhole, the A/B fell unconscious on a platform just below the manhole, due to gas emissions from the cargo, that had gathered inside the hold. The bosun then, notified by the O/S who remained on top of the manhole, descended through the manhole's ladder to help the A/B, but fell unconscious as well. Two more crew members (an A/B and an O/S) fell also unconscious, following the bosun.
Eventually, the O/S who was on top of the manhole, notified the 3rd officer who was on watch and then the C/O. The 3rd officer took an oxygen apparatus and entered the manhole to the cargo hold, but due to malfunction of the oxygen supply came up again. Then the C/O descended in the cargo hold and managed help one A/B up the ladder before getting dizzy and returning to main deck. Then he came down again and succeeded in tying up with a safety belt the the O/S, the second A/B and eventually the bosun.
First aid was applied on the main deck to the 4 crew members who fell unconscious in the cargo hold, but only 2 of them became conscious. All 4 of them were taken to hospital by ambulance (one A/B and the O/S in relatively good condition, one A/B and the bosun in critical condition).

Once the sling hook had been freed, they began walking forward between the load spreaders and the side of the hold. As they walked, the bosun signalled to the second mate to raise the hook.

When the technician and the bosun were about half way along the side of load spreaders, the two ABs saw the topmost load spreader lift up and start to slide off the top of the pack. They shouted warnings to the second mate and the two men, however, there was not enough time for either of the men to move clear and they were both struck by the load spreader as it slid towards them.

On the bridge, the chief mate heard the loud noise of the load spreader falling. As he made his way to the ’tween deck he called the second mate on the radio and asked what had happened. When he got closer, he heard the cries of the injured men. He called the master, advised that there had been an accident and that medical assistance was required. The master asked the ship’s agent, who was on board at the time, to arrange for medical assistance from ashore.

At about 0910, the first paramedics from McConnell Dowell, the company constructing the wharf, arrived. Shortly afterwards, other emergency service personnel from McConnell Dowell, the Fire and Emergency Service and St John Ambulance arrived.

The injured men were freed by the ship’s crew with the assistance of shore personnel. Both were then stabilised and prepared for evacuation. At about 1005, the bosun was lifted ashore and taken to Port Hedland hospital. About 50 minutes later, the technician was lifted ashore and taken to the hospital

The rate was higher than the ratio step - known system speed.When the bow of the ship reached alignment of the West-Northern Dock, speed was 10.5 knots and slowing down but not at the required rate. Therefore, the captain decided to enter the Guadiaro basin, wider, to make the turning of the vessel, rather than in the Heredia basin, located to the SW, where it was originally scheduled to dock.The captain gave the order to all stern but the port propeller remained ahead. Therefore, the captain decided to drop the two anchors, so that the ship could reduce but not stop her way ahead. The ship ended up colliding at a speed of about 3 knots against the pier number 1, boarding a yacht docked in it.There were no injuries.CONCLUSIONSThe report made by the technician of WRTSIL makes no assumptions about the failure of the control of the LIPS system, so it can not be determined whether the fault was caused by the power supplies, due to the installation of the RDT, or otherwise not found in view of technical recommendation to renew the system given its relative antiquity.Notwithstanding the foregoing, the report shows that, in relation to the control system LIPS, there are two security issues: 1) The voltage oscillations in blocks supply of the electronic boards of the control system of the LIPS.2) The connection of the control system of the RDT to LIPS (notwithstanding the appreciation of technician of WRTSIL that such a connection was inadequate, it worked smoothly since its installation during years).The Company has demonstrated having made the necessary corrective actions of these two points, providing a report and a notice of assistance from WRTSIL.","Passenger / Ro-Ro Cargo Ship","Ship remains fit to proceed","22940","Bureau Veritas (BV)","5567","Other cargo","52","50","","","","","","","","2019-11-19",""

The tanker was inbound and was moving very slowly ahead while waiting for the pilot from the container ship to board. Both vessels suffered major structural damage to their bows but there were no injuries or pollution. The collision resulted from several factors. In particular, a passing arrangement was not agreed or promulgated and the actions of both masters were based on assumptions. The tanker was unnecessarily close to the channel entrance and the tanker’s master acted on scanty VHF radio information. In addition, the container ship's bridge team did not keep a proper lookout or monitor the tanker’s movement. They only realised that the tanker was close ahead seconds before the collision when alerted by the port control. The accident occurred within port limits. The precautions of pilotage and the port’s vessel traffic service, which would normally co-ordinate and de-conflict the movements of vessels in the port area, were ineffective on this occasion.","Oil Tanker","Ship rendered unfit to proceed","79779","","","","28","0","","","","","","","","2017-03-17",""

At approximately 12.00 hrs, at the end of a dredge run, it was noticed that the dredge was heavier than normal and the possibility of fouling on a wire or rope was suspected. When the dredge was hoisted to the surface it contained a large boulder. The vessel was significantly trimmed by the stern and the Skipper came aft from the wheelhouse to assess the situation. The vessel rolled on a swell and instantly capsized throwing the three crewmen into the water under the vessel. They swam free from under the vessel which then sank rapidly.

The crewman spent approximately 49 minutes in the water and was unresponsive when eventually recovered onto a rescue craft launched from a nearby offshore support vessel. The accident occurred because the crewman was standing in an unsafe position. It is one of a number of recent accidents in which fishermen have died after falling or being carried or swept overboard while trawling when the vessels’ crews have been unable to recover them back on board. In this case, the trawler's crew had not completed a practical manoverboard drill during their time on board and they were unfamiliar with the manoverboard recovery system carried. 
Recommendations have been made to the Maritime regulator and industry bodies. These are aimed at identifying initiatives to encourage fishermen to conduct practical emergency drills and to use risk assessments as a catalyst for behavioural change. The recommendations are also intended to improve the likelihood of recovering persons from the water by ensuring that the recovery systems carried by fishing vessels are suitable and that sufficient and realistic manoverboard drills are carried out on board. A recommendation has also been made to the trawler's owner, which seeks to improve the overall safety of its crews, and their ability to respond to emergencies.","Fish Catching Vessel","","331","","","","6","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","2016-01-19",""

Initially, Xuan Lam 10, with IMO number 9634775, encountered strong waves and high winds on 18 January while en route from Quang Binh to Phu Yen, Vietnam. The 2011-built vessel soon took water in its cargo hold at around 21.00 hours local time and developed list to port.
Crew of the Xuan Lam 10 then attempted to pump out the water from the cargo ship, but their efforts were futile. They issued a distress call and abandoned the ship before it sank 1.4 miles off Quang Ngai, Vietnam in Lat. 15 10 N Long. 108 55E, at 00.30 hours local time yesterday.
Later, a fishing vessel, Qng 91007, rescued all the 10 crew of Xuan Lam 10 after picking up the distress call while passing through the area. No injuries were reported and the crew were subsequently brought ashore for medical attention.
Further investigation will be carried by Vietnamese authorities to determine the cause of the sinking.

At about 0850H LT, the chief officer, accompanied by the second officer and an OS entered the void space with an AB standing by on deck. After inspecting the ballast pipe where it passed through the common bulkhead with # 3 center double bottom tank void space ((#3C DBT VS), they exited the void space.
But then at about 0910H LT, the chief officer ordered the AB and OS to open the access manhole of #3C DBT VS, intending to inspect the flange coupling/expansion piece on the other side of the common bulkhead in #3C DBT VS.

When the chief officer and second officer themselves had reached the main deck, the second officer reminded the chief officer that the space would need to be ventilated and checked before entry. The chief officer replied that the trunking already had ventilation and “it would be all right”. The second officer then asked the chief officer if he should notify the bridge, to which the chief officer replied in effect that it was not necessary. The chief officer then entered the access trunk at about 0930H LT.
The AB and OS had already proceeded through the access hatch and down the ladder to open the manhole at the forward end of the void space. After opening the manhole and waiting about 10 minutes, the AB commenced entry into the tank to assess the condition of the air. When partially through the manhole, the AB smelled noxious fumes and became nauseated. He immediately vacated the area, and both he and the OS climbed back to the main deck.

As they were going up, they met the chief officer descending the ladder. The AB said the manhole was open but there was gas present. The chief officer essentially ignored both the warnings of the second officer and the AB and continued down to the bottom shell plating. 

Shortly afterwards the chief officer was found lying on the deck bleeding from his head. When the alarm was raised, the chief engineer, without donning a breathing apparatus, climbed down the ladder in an attempt to rescue the chief officer, but then he passed out and collapsed.

On 08/01/2015 at about 23:00 hours LT departed from Hamburg-Germany, bound for Antwerp - Belgium. The weather forecast for the intended voyage was very rough sea, with strong winds. On 10/01/2015 at 01:26 hours LT two Sea Pilots climbed the port side combination ladder. Sea Pilots advised the Master that the River Pilots will be boarded from the starboard side at Flushing Pilot Station. The Master ordered the Bosun to re-arrange the combination ladder from the port side to the starboard side. The Bosun with two Ordinary Seamen (OS1 & OS2) proceeded to re-arrange the combination ladder from the port side to the starboard side. They were wearing coveralls, reflective winter jackets, safety shoes, gloves, inflatable life-vests and helmets. They also had one safety harness for the person going down to the gangway platform to make fast the pilot ladder on the gangway so as not swinging. Due to the strong wind, the Bosun and his team (OS1& OS2) put their helmets aside. They unsecured the gangway and before it turned horizontal they adjusted the gangway's lower platform and put the stanchions. Then they turned the gangway horizontal and hoisted the stanchions of the (gangway's) upper platform. After they lowered a little bit, about 1 metre and hoisted up the gangway's railings. Then they dropped the pilot ladder, about 1 metre over the water. After they lowered the gangway a little bit more, made adjustment again. The OS2 was securing the pilot ladder on the deck with a rope. The OS1 was secured with a life-line attached on his safety harness. The life-line was fasted on the deck railings. OS1 went down on the gangway's lower platform to secure (make fast) the pilot ladder on the gangway with a small rope. When the OS1 was standing on the lower platform trying to pull the pilot ladder close to the gangway, a wave washed him into the sea. The vessel's freeboard was about 10 metres. The length of the life-line was about the same length. At the time of the accident, the ship was turning to port, and the weather was almost astern, closer to the starboard quarter. When the wave was going down the OS1 was hanging, but when the wave was going up he was in the water. Man-Over-Board procedure was implemented. The Master sounded the General Alarm, announced Man overboard and stopped the Main Engine. One Sea Pilot informed Steen Bank Traffic about the Man-Over-Board incident. A Life-Ring with line was thrown towards the OS1. The Master maneuvered the vessel to make a lee for recovering the OS1. Within about 10 minutes, crew members recovered the OS1 from the sea and placed him on the Main Deck. Artificial respiration and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was provided by crew members but without results. Declaration of death was issued about one hour later, after examination by a Search and Rescue (SAR) Medical Officer, Physician in the Royal Netherlands Navy who boarded the ship. Subsequent post mortem examination 6 concluded that the death of the OS1 resulted from thrusts by the waves for 10 minutes on the vessel's side shell, which caused heavy shock in the thoracic area.","Container Ship","Loss of life","38364","[Other]","46925","","20","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","2020-05-07",""

HAUGESUND was later brought to draft and trim; water ingress was eventually stopped. Brazilian Naval Inspectors boarded vessel to investigate. Surveyors and Flag State representatives later investigated. E.R. HAUGESUND was eventually towed to ENAVI shipyard pier with the assistance of tugs: Mercurio IV, Flora, and Vigo Maximum. Repairs were carried out accordingly.","Offshore Supply Ship","Ship rendered unfit to proceed","2180","DNV GL AS (DNVGL)","3240","","","","","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","",""

There has been no sign of the eight-strong crew.

The vessel's upturned hull was found by a passing ferry in the Pentland Firth on Saturday.

There had been no distress call from the ship, which was carrying a bulk load of cement from Denmark.

The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said the search had involved two helicopters and four lifeboats, assisted by coastguard rescue teams from Kirkwall, St Margaret's Hope, Duncansby, Scrabster and Wick.

The last confirmed sighting of the ship was at about 13:00 on Friday. It is understood the alarm was raised by the crew of the ferry Hrossey at 14:30 on Saturday.

The Hrossey, which was sailing to Aberdeen, spent time in the area looking for survivors.

An inflatable boat was recovered by a team in Orkney, but the coastguard said they have been unable to confirm if it came from the Cemfjord.

Wick RNLI station said on Saturday: ""We got a call this afternoon about two o'clock that the Shetland ferry - the Hrossey - she had spotted the hull of a coaster upside-down 10 miles east of Pentland Skerries.

ALYARMOUK was en route from Tanjung Pelapas, Malaysia to China, while SINAR KAPUAS was on its way to Singapore from Hong Kong when the incident occurred.

ALYARMOUK reported that one of her cargo tanks sustained damage, resulting in spillage of crude oil.

It is understood, the two vessels involved in the collision are currently safely anchored and in a stable condition and the traffic in port and the Strait of Singapore remains unaffected.

It is estimated by V. Ships UK Ltd., the manager of ALYARMOUK, taht 4,500 tonnes of Madura crude oil was spilt from the tanker.  Taking into account the weather and tidal currents, trajetory modelling suggests that patches of oil may affect the northern parts of the island of Bintan, Indonesia, however as of 5 January 2015, no reports of shoreline impact have been received.  Given the general specification of Madura crude oil, it is understood that a significant proportion (up to 70%) would be expected to evaporate and naturally disperse within a short time frame, following release into the marine environment.","Crude Oil Tanker","Pollution,Ship remains fit to proceed","61342","","116039","","","","","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","",""
