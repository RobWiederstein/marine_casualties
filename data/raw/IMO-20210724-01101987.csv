DOS, disappeared while in passage from the port Cabo de Cruz, Boiro (Pontevedra) in the Ria of Villagarcia, to a mussel-farm at Muros (A Corua) in the adjacent Ria de Muros y Noia. Aboard were three people. Only one body could be recovered from the sea next day. The other two crewmembers remain missing.These vessels, known as ""bateeiros"" are service ships for these farms, specifically built up to navigate in abriged waters. The vessel had no permits to get out from the Ria de Villagarca. CONCLUSIONS IN THE REPORT PAQUITO No. DOS sank concatenating several accidental occurrences. Below are listed the same supposedly following a chronological order, but sometimes the exact moment that occurred is unknown. The order in which they appear not prejudge primacy of one over the other, because in this case all of them have proved aids the accident factors. Contributing factors that lie behind the events which have determined the CIAIM but in the background are the true causes of the accident has occurred are listed below. 1. Roles and responsibilities in the operation of the boat were not clear . The Company delegated to the skipper of the boat maintenance and technical management of their exploitation. The pattern of initiative and provided extensive autonomy. This contributed to the control of the vessel by its owner were not effective. As stated, the owner was unaware that the vessel could not be used to navigate between the estuaries of Arosa and Muros. 2. The Company was using the boat for some work and traffic for which the boat was not ready. Its design, understood in a broad sense, was not adequate. The EAP PAQUITO No. DOS was classified as Class S;ie vessels that can not go to sea and whose voyages are to be made in ports and sheltered harbors. Neither was considered a fishing boat but a fishing dinghy. Therefore, among other considerations, it was not required to carry safety features as inflatable vests work or beacon. If the boat had had these elements, in line with navigation made, the crew would have had more opportunities to save their lives. 3. From the above two points concludes that the Company did not maintain a clear, explicit realpolitik on safety at work of the crew of his boat . 4. The procedures for loading and transport of the mussel out of the estuary were inadequate . Routine procedures were followed in the ordinary performance inside the Ria de Arosa. The crew did not consider, wrongly, that these procedures were not applicable in open seas. a. Mussel was loaded on deck bulk without separations or partitions, despite being a likely shift in shipment of navigation in open seas. Calculations show that in this case turned out to be more important that the load could move than the total weight of the deck cargo. b. The boat was not prepared to sea. The evidence found suggests that the team was deposited on deck without lashing, or without adequate lashing. The boat was loaded so and usually, but within the estuary. c. The access door to the engine room from the deck was opened. d. The skipper did not consult the weather information provided or checked the condition of the sea outside the Ria de Arosa. The conditions inside the estuary were good, which may have confused the skipper. From this point also it follows that the preparation of the trip was inadequate . 5. An important element for reflexion is to consider whether the skipper had the initiative or enough support from owners to face an emergency . Despite warning that sea conditions outside the estuary were very adverse the skipper did not return to port. Arguably, the conditions may have become so hard that made it impossible to turn around. Had it been the case, the skipper was committed to have identified such sea conditions, as well as other conditions (boat, equipment and cargo) of that voyage and have not reached that hypothetical point of ""no return."" 6. From everything said so far it follows that safety awareness was absent or was at the limit of what is acceptable. This conclusion is to be understood in a broad sense, extended to all participants in the trip of PAQUITO No. DOS.","Fish Catching Vessel","Loss of life,Pollution,Ship rendered unfit to proceed,Total loss of the ship","63.83","","","Fish in bulk","3","0","1","3","0","0","0","0","0","2019-10-25",""

On 12 December 2014, the master took over the navigational watch at 0800 for his normal 0800-1200 watch. The master was the duty OOW. One of the ABs reported that he was also on duty on the bridge. The master recalled that at some point after 1100, he went to the chart room to look for a chart because he had realised that it was not in the file used for that particular voyage. Just before 1115, the master noticed that the vessel was heading into shallow waters and a reef, which was dead ahead. The master observed that the vessel was too close to the reef and that he would not be able to avoid the grounding, even if he had to do a bold alteration of the course. The AB stated that suddenly he felt a very strong jolt. In shock and stunned, he immediately ran down to the accommodation area to inform all the crew members that the vessel had just ran aground.

While the vessel was enroute on voyage from Cristobal to Port of Spain, on December 11th, (08:30 hours LT), 2nd Engineer informs to navigational bridge, that 4th Engineer (Mr. Gopalakrishnan Praveen) did not report himself in Engine Room, and was not found in his cabin.  According information from 2nd Engineer: “The Fourth Engineer was not present for daily work at 08:00 hours (December 11, 2014)”.  He tried calling him to his cabin, but his phone was busy.  Then, he instructed E/O, who was with him at same time in the Engine Control Room, to go and call 4th Engineer in his cabin, and also check his phone.  After E/O checking, he reported that 4th Engineer was not in his cabin and his phone was disconnected.  Also, E/O was instructed by 2nd Engineer to check common places onboard, as mess room and smoke room, but he was not found in any of those places.  At around 08:30 hours (Vessel approaching to Port of Spain pilot station), 2nd Engineer called to navigational bridge, in order to informs, that 4th Engineer, was not found in Engine Room, neither inside of accommodation area.

It is understood the sinking was a result of damage sustained following a collision with an empty cargo vessel TOTAL amid dense fog, which also caused a spill of cargo of unknown quantity.

About 52 hours after sinking, news reports suggest the oil tanker was dragged toward the shoreline within Joymoni forest range on Thursday, 11 December, by local salvors.  In addition it is reported that two navy ships and two other rescue vessels sent from Barisal and Narayanganj have not also reached the incident site.

Following the collision, the seven crew members managed to swim ashore, however, the master of the oil tanker, Mr. Mokhlesur Rahman, still remains missing.

It is understood there were eight inter-connected tanks in the tanker, six of which reputured following the collision.  It has not been confirmed how much oil has spilled, news reports suggest that most of the cargo has now spilled into the river stretching over around 50 kilometres along the Shela and Pashur rivers.

There are concerns regarding the likely scale of environmental damage, the Sundarbans being one of the world's largest Mangrove forests, an ecosystem particularly sensitve to oil contamination in addition to the incident sites proximity to the Chadpai Wildlife Sactuary, home to a number of threatened species of dolphin.

The vessel which rammed the fishing boat continued on her voyage without altering course and / or reducing speed.
Ro-ro cargo vessel Fides, which was also allegedly involved in the collision, was on a Southeasterly course from Monfalcone, Italy to Derince, Izmit, Turkey with a speed of 14.5 knots.
No one was injured and Nika’s three crew members were rescued by another fishing boat (Giglio Del Mare), which was also engaged in fishing operations in the area. However, Nika sustained severe damages in way of her port bow area, which was totally destroyed by the collision. About 25 minutes after the collision, she lost her reserve buoyancy and foundered within the area.
No pollution was reported, however, the fishing boat sunk with about 400 litres of gas oil on board.

However, the connecting piece of the two wires got snagged on a transverse (cross section) of the crane s jib.The Bosun who was standing at the crane s platform directly below the control cabin, walked out onto the crane s boom wearing a safety harness and moved towards the cross section to unsnag the connecting piece. When he reached to the cross section he attached his safety harness to the old wire that was being replaced. While he was standing on the jib's cross section he lost his balance and fell from a height of 9.5 meters on the cargo hold s hatch cover.

The NMA’s notification was based on an accident report from the shipping company. The crew on board Star Kvarven had spotted the other vessel but they had not registered any collision. They notified the shipping company, the agent and Chinese authorities, and participated in the subsequent search and rescue operation. The Chinese search and rescue (SAR) authorities searched for three days for survivors, but did not find any. It is assumed that Lulanyu 61809 sank after the collision with Star Kvarven and that all the eight crew members on board died.

The vessel ran aground as it was about to enter port without a pilot.
The vessel sustained substantial and serious damage to all of her double bottom tanks and bottom structure.  She was subsequently refloated following a lightering operation to reduce her draught to an acceptable level in order for her to berth.
The safety investigation concluded that a number of factors linked to the prevailing environmental conditions had adversely affected the vessel’s entry into the port.  The dynamic under keel clearance of the vessel was also reduced, resulting in the master losing control of the vessel and ultimately being set onto the South breakwater.","General Cargo Ship","Ship remains fit to proceed","2497","[Other]","4175","Solid cargo - Dry bulk","8","0","0","","","","","","","2015-12-30",""

To assist in positioning of the bulkhead, a person's basket attached to the gantry with an electric chain hoist was used. The swivel hook of the electric chain hoist failed and caused the death of a crew member. 
Unfortunately this was not the first time the utilized electrical chain hoist had failed, or was to fail. The issue had already been investigated by the exellent casualty authority of Finland who had found out issues with the certification for lifting persons for the employed kit/parts of the electrical tackle. In the Finnish case with the vessel also beeing A&B flagged, the manufacturing company of the gantry was contacted and informed of the encountered difficulties, letting them make the recommendation of a fall preventing device to ensure a back up to hold the basket. This was not done on the Gerhard G. 
A short while after the accident on Gerhard G, the cooperating authority of the Netherlands informed our office that a similar accident had occurred on a Dutch vessel prompting further investigation and communication with the manufacturer.
As the accident is clearly an occupational accident, it would not ask for a Full Marine Casualty Investigation on first sight, but given the reoccurrence and seriousness of the matter, the Antigua & Barbuda Chief Casualty Investigator has made the decision to go ahead with an investigation, orientated around all 3 events.

After mooring alongside the fenders under the Stallbacka bridge the vessel sank to the bottom of the channel without capsizing. The Swedish Maritime Administration channel center in Trollhttan, received a call via VHF from the vessel at 12:46. About three minutes later the pilot of the vessel told the channel center that they should arrange so the water-tap in the channel was reduced in order to minimize the speed of the current in the channel. The pilot also requested the Maritime Administrations tugboat to the scene. The channel center alerted the SOS-alarm center. The call was received via the emergency number 112 and it was connected with JRCC and the control center at the local fire brigade in Trollhttan, (NRF). During the ongoing call, JRCC found that the geographical location of the accident site, meant that the rescue operation was the responsibility of the municipal rescue services. SOS Alarm then alerted the municipal rescue services in Trollhttan. The vessel was evacuated and the Captain and all his crew went over to the tug boat that at this time had arrived at the scene.

After completing the previous project on 22 October 2014, the vessel dropped anchor at 05:05 PM LT in Manila Bay, at position 14.55 N, 120.94 E. The vessel was scheduled to mobilize to the next project in Taiwan around mid-November. While at anchor, the crew was performing regular maintenance tasks and some preparation for the next docking. 
On the day of the occurrence, the deck crew took part in a daily Pre-Start Meeting (PSM) at around 06:00 AM, discussing the tasks for the day. The PSM was chaired by the Chief Officer as the Captain was not present on deck. One of the tasks was to perform thickness measurements of the hopper walls, side, fore and aft plates. The 2nd Pipe Operator (day shift) and the Apprentice Pipe Operator, both attending the PSM, were assigned to the task.
First, the hopper was filled with water after the aft overflow was blinded off and the fore overflow set at 11.82 m. A small boat was then lowered into the hopper and the crew assigned to the task entered the boat with their equipment. After the first set of measurements, the unsecured boat with both occupants was located at the aft starboard (SB) part of the hopper. After radio co-ordination with the Chief Officer on the bridge, the water level was lowered for the next level thickness checks. 
While the water level was being lowered, the crew in the boat tried to paddle to the front port side (PS) of the hopper, but the strong current caused by the outflowing water made the boat bump against the overflow. At that point, according to the statement of the 2nd Pipe Operator (day shift), the Apprentice Pipe Operator stood up to grab for a hold. The boat became unstable and flipped over. Both occupants fell into the hopper and got pulled down through the overflow. The 2nd Pipe Operator (day shift) exited under the vessel s hull and managed to swim to the surface, where he was subsequently rescued. Unfortunately the Apprentice Pipe Operator was missing. His floating body was found the following day close to the ship near the trunnion gantry.","Dredger","Serious injuries","17370","","","","35","0","","1","0","0","1","0","0","2017-01-09",""

Two of its crew were rescued and the body of the skipper was recovered but the remaining two crewmen were not found.
Ocean Way had been running before a very rough sea with water washing regularly onto its main deck when the skipper alerted the crew, who were in the vessel’s communal cabin below deck that the vessel was capsizing. Four men escaped from the vessel and two of them managed to climb onto the upturned hull before the vessel sank a short time later. The two men then clung to two lifebuoys, which were the only lifesaving equipment to float free from the vessel after the sinking.
At 1058 a transmission from Ocean Way’s Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon (EPIRB) was received but this did not give the vessel’s position. At 1145 the position of the EPIRB was confirmed and at 1155 a helicopter was tasked to proceed to that position. Two survivors were located at 1354 and the skipper’s body was recovered a short time later.

The accident was caused by the close quarter s situation that arose between the taxi boat and the pleasure boat not being detected and averted in time. A contributing factor was both parties' lack of lookout. Factors that contributed to the poor lookout could have been the circumstances that the driver of the pleasure boat was under the influence of alcohol and the motor design on the outboard motor with the placement of the tiller at the engines port side which lead to the driver sitting on the starboard side of the pleasure boat with his back turned towards the starboard side.

The safety investigation concluded that the fire was a result of possible hot works (steel cuttings) being carried out by shipyard s workers in way of bilge tank located aft of the engine room compartments during the night shift on 29 September 2014.
 The fire broke out in the main engine-room, aft port side and was first noticed by the engine-room watchman who initially tried to put out the fire on his own, by means of a portable CO2 fire extinguisher.  The fire was eventually extinguished during the early hours of 30 September following the release of the fixed CO2 system of the vessel into the main engine-room

The chief engineer was on the shore at the back of the ship, where he let go ships last line of the stern by the usual procedure. The master of the ship launched both engines to move the ship off the coast and continued moving the ship to the inner part of the breakwater. As the chief engeener has not reported to the wheelhouse, the master realized something was wrong and went looking for a chief engeener. Having found that the chief engeener is not on board, the master goes by boat to the main mole where, with the help of skippers on the neighboring yacht, somehow binds and informs employees of the nearby hotel (who ran to the mole) to go looking for a missing engineer.

The deck crane s combined cabin unit and jib parted from its pedestal base and fell into cargo hold no. 5, striking the open hatch cover as it toppled over.
 
The stevedore operating the deck crane became trapped inside the cabin and it took the shore emergency services some time to extricate him from the wreckage and land him ashore. The crane operator sustained serious injury to one of his legs and minor injuries to his head.
 
Discharging operations were suspended and the managers arranged for the cargo to be discharged by shore cranes until such time the remaining cranes could be thoroughly inspected.
 
The safety investigation concluded that the immediate cause of the accident was the failure of the slewing ring due to pre-existing upper and lower circumferential fatigue cracks. The fatigue cracking initiated at the undercut fillets above and below the extended nose portion of the nose ring.

During the stopover, the tug's captain and chief officer decided to go ashore in an open dinghy which was on board the dredger being towed. Once ashore, the captain and the chief officer bought provisions and consumed several alcoholic drinks. When they returned to the dinghy, the weather had deteriorated. During the transit back to the tug, which was anchored approximately 1600m past the harbour breakwater, the dinghy was swamped and partially foundered. The captain and chief officer started to swim back to the tug. The remaining 2 crewmen on board the tug saw what happened and one of them climbed into a lifering, jumped in, and swam towards the master and mate, carrying 2 lifejackets with him. The mate put one of the lifejackets on and then swam to the master who, by now, was face down in the water. A local military patrol vessel came to assist. The chief officer was recovered but the tug's master could not be resuscitated.

One of the vessel's crew (AB), was unfortunately overcome by conditions within the engine room, and declared deceased after attempts to revive him failed. 

The ship lost all power, limiting the extent of its communications and the emergency generator also failed, apparently due to a faulty automatic voltage regulator (AVR).

Travel plan was prepared for the crossing by the second officer taking into consideration that areas of Dongshan in general tend to have many fishing boats, and was approved by the master and signed by officers of navigation. 

The navigation of the vessel from its output of Phu My developed in normal conditions.
August 02, 2014:  the ship began to enter Chinese coastal waters, to the 1600 LT on the same day they met with a few fishing boats because they were far away from the coast.
August 03, 2014: the ship started its voyage through the Strait of Taiwan, all the navigation equipment were in optimum working condition. The rudder was in automatic mode, two radars were in transmission mode, the No.1 of X-band radar was adjusted to a range of 6 MN and radar No. 2 of S-band 3 MN to check the situation in the area. Sometimes second officer fit the X-band radar to a range of 12 MN Exchange to verify the status of some fishing boats that were later.

At 0155 LT:  the ship reached the point of reversal (way point) in the travel plan No. 20 in position latitude 23 ° 31.0 N and longitude 118 ° 06.5 E and made the change of course to 053 degrees, speed approximately 14.6 knots.  At that time the officer on duty realized that a fishing boat was trying to cross the bow from port to starboard of the ship.  The Radar indicated a CPA of 5 cables but brings it closer and closer.

At 0200 LT:  the second officer (Duty Officer) noted that there was a large amount of fishing boats both by their side of port and starboard doing fishing operations, due to the large quantity of these the second official ordered the AB (Helmsman of Guard)  change the rudder to manual mode. The course carrying at that time was 053° and a speed of 14.6 knots. 

At 0205 LT:  in order to warn the fishing boat that was by his bow from port, the second officer used the signal lamp (Aldis), but this continued trying to pass by the bow of the ship, then the second officer ordered 20 degrees starboard to avoid the fishing boat.  

At 0210 LT:  the second officer spotted on the radar a fishing boat which was at risk of collision from its bow on the starboard side of the ship at low speed, and some other fishing vessels close to it. In those moments, the speed of the fishing vessel by its port was about 3.5 knots and heading approximately 060° course. The distance was 5 Cables. The point of closest approach (CPA) was 3 Cables. So the second officer had to take steps to clarify the fishing boat. At that time were at least six fishing vessels by the amura of port and at least eight fishing vessels by its bow on the starboard of the ship.

Approximately at 215 LT, the direction of the ship was some 073 ° and ordered it to remain fixed. The speed of the boat was about 14.6 knots. At that time, he saw that the fishing vessel's port side changed its course to port and also reduced its speed. However, the fishing vessel to starboard began to move at a speed of about 3.5 knots. By means of radar, binocular and own view found the distance was 5 Cables.  He glimpsed its course near 280 ° from the point of closest approach (CPA) of 0-3 MN, and time to the CPA was about 8 minutes.

The fishing boat did not send any signal. Second officer ordered the Helmsman of Guard (AB) port 10 ° then 20 ° port and then everything to port and the vessel altered course to port as he had ordered. But the fishing boat began to increase its speed and tried to pass in front of the boat to an approximate heading of 280 °. The second officer used a signaling lamp to warn the fishing vessel not to cross the bow of the ship, but there was no response. He used no sound nor VHF radio signals because he believed that they would not be able to speak in English.

Between  0216-0220 LT the ""Ultra Vanscoy"" collided with the fishing boat Min Dong Yu 63285 approximately in position latitude 23 ° 35.0 N and longitude 118 ° 12.2E and at an angle of collision around 80-90 degrees.

Stella Maris listed as its cod end was being lifted from the sea by a high, stern-mounted gantry sited above the vessel’s fish hopper and shelter deck. The skipper recognised that the weight of the cod end was excessive and attempted to lower it back into the sea. Unfortunately the netting became ensnared on a net drum guide pole and the gilson winch was unable to re-lift the cod end to clear this obstruction. The vessel’s list continued to
increase, causing the starboard quarter bulwark to become submerged, prompting the crew to abandon the vessel.

On 18 July 2014 at about 2040, an incident into the sinking of Singapore registered, non-propelled, semi-submersible barge POSH Mogami occurred about 2 nautical miles northeast of Sekupang, Batam, Indonesia.

The incident occurred in fine weather and calm sea while conducting trial submersion operation prior to the actual submersion operations planned for next day.
Investigations revealed the incident was not due to hull or machinery failure. It occurred during subsequent surfacing operation i.e. after successful trial submersion to 20m.
During ballasting operation (submersion), ballast Operator filled the tanks according to builder’s ballast plan. The decision to stop ballast operations was due to POSH Mogami’s forward and aft draught reaching 20m as verified by draught gauges and visual sighting of the draught marks.

During deballasting operation (surfacing), the ballast Operator did not follow the builder's de-ballasting plan which was the primary causal factor to the incident. The situation was further exacerbated due to his inadequate knowledge of barge ballast tanks air vent, either independent or common air duct venting/ overflow system 

Several other factors appeared to have contributed to the incident;
•	Project Manager’s inadequate supervision when he left most of the decision making on ballasting/ deballasting operations to PE;
•	Project Manager’s ineffective command and control when he did not carry out a proper ‘Toolbox Meeting’; and
•	Project Team appeared insufficiently trained for submersion and surfacing operation;

As a result of the incident, three members of the Project Team, involved in trial submersion operation could not escape the sinking barge and died, while six others managed to escape with minor injuries.

On 24 November 2014, the Owner reported that the barge had been salvaged. On re-floating, POSH Mogami had sustained material damage and could not continue with operations.

After passing the coast of South Africa and South Madagascar, afire broke out in the upper parts of the engine room. 

Initially, some confusion was caused by the appearance of the fire, 5 decks down the engine casing, at the exhaust gas boiler (economiser). However, it was later established that the fire was primarily in the incinerator room on the 2nd deck down from the upper deck and that burning debris had dropped through gratings, to the 5th deck. 

The first fire fighting action was to provide boundary cooling on the funnel and engine room access stairway and elevator trunking. The fire at the economiser deck (car deck no 7) was extinguished and various attempts were made to access the centre of the fire at the incinerator deck from the engine room and also from the car decks via the entrances on the stairway on the 2nd and 3rd decks. 

The vessel blacked out approximately 20 minutes after the fire detection system alarm was triggered due to short circuiting of electrical cables located in the access stairway trunking between the engine room and the upper deck. 

The fire fighting continued, using the emergency fire pump, driven from the emergency generator and was eventually extinguished approximately 3 hours after it started. 

The damage to the electrical cabling resulted in the main engine only being controllable from the local manoeuvring position and communications from the bridge to the engine room being disabled. 

Consideration was given to arranging the cabling to permit communications between the bridge, engine control room, engine local control and steering gear. However the main engine monitoring and alarm system was also compromised due to cabling damage and it was decided to arrange a tug to tow the vessel to Durban, Republic of South Africa for repairs. The tow by tug Pacific Peacock of the Tai Shan was completed at 09:42 hours on the 15th July 2014 with the arrival at Durban pilot station, having averaged 3.6 knots for the passage.

For some reason, they both ended up in the water. The incident was learned of when the empty boat was found circling at high speed, leading to the immediate commencement of a rescue operation. The two missing individuals were found deceased but not until three days later. A probable cause of both falling overboard is that due to the headwind and gusty weather, one of the empty plastic crates on board was blown into the helmsman, who thereby lost his grip on the tiller. This in turn caused the boat to heel over so severely that both fell overboard. The investigation has revealed that the boat had been CE marked under the condition that it was fitted with a steering console, but that this fact was lost on the way between the boat designer and the buyer. The boat was fitted with a 100 horsepower outboard motor which was steered with the same lever as for the throttle (tiller steering), which was easy to turn even if the friction screw was activated. The motor was deemed to be too large for tiller steering. No safety equipment, such as buoyant clothing or a dead man's switch, was used. Additional discoveries that emerged during the course of the investigation include the fact that the supervisory authority for CE marking has minor resources for this task and that there were some communication problems in connection with the rescue operation. The rescue service organisations concerned have improved their conditions for communication, and the supervisory authority has conducted a survey of resource distribution for checking CE marking.","Fish Catching Vessel","Loss of life,Ship remains fit to proceed","","","","","","","","2","","","","","","2020-12-09",""

The vessel anchored at the position in Western Petroleum ‘B” anchorage in Lat 01° 13.11’N, Lat 103° 48.22E.. The officers kept the normal anchor watches.  

On 12 June 2014, at 0245 hours while lying at anchorage the vessel experienced a sudden gust of very strong wind blowing. The 2nd Officer estimated a wind force of 8-9. (Please see Deck Log entries above). The 2nd Officer and an AB were on watch and observed that a vessel forward of her bow was dragging her anchor towards their ship “DL Navig8”. Under the circumstances, he could not do anything. However, he informed the 2nd Engineer to put the engine on stanby. At the same time, he immediately informed the Master of the situation.

At 0248 hours, the vessel tried to make contact with the other vessel “Tian E Zuo” by all available means, by VHF channels and making continous sound signals of the ship’s whistle to attract her attention. Despite all the efforts by the vessel, there was no response from the other vessel. Meantime the “Tian E Zuo” was dragging its anchor with a bunkering barge alongside her starboard side. She was taking bunker. Both vessels were dragging together towards the “DL Navig8” which was at anchor and stationary. At 0300 hours, contact of the vessels was imminent and the “DL Navig8” engine was rung on “Standby”. Both the dragging vessels’ sterns were going to hit the bow of the DL Navig8”.     

At 0315 hours, the stern of the “Tian E Zuo” hit the bow of the “DL Navig8”. At 0318 hours, the starboard quarter of the bunker barge “Marine Liberty” hit the “DL Navig8 on the starboard bow. The vessel checked the extent of the damage and if any ingress of water into its forepeak and ballast tanks. The Port Control was informed of the incident by the vessel. The incident occurred in Lat 01° 13.3’N, Long 103° 48.6’E at Western Pertroleum “B” anchorage. Because of the impact, the vessel MT “DL Navig8” sustained damage to her stem and the bulbous bow. 
Immediately, the vessel “DL Navig8 tried to heave up her anchor but found that her anchor chain was caught underneath the stern of the vessel “Marine Liberty” starboard quarter that made it difficult for the vessel to heave up its anchor.
At 0354 hours, the “Tian E Zuo let go of the “Marine Liberty” lines. At 0404 hours, “Marine Liberty” was cleared of the “Tian E Zuo”. The vessel tried to contact “Marine Liberty” on the VHF but there was no response from her and she headed away from the vessel. At 0411 hours, the vessel commenced heaving up and anchor aweigh at 0427 hours. At 0430 hours, the vessel got instruction from Port Control to report the matter to Port Safety. At 0454 hours, the vessel dropped anchor at position in Lat. 01° 13.18’N, Long 103° 48.17E.

Korea.

Passage plan was prepared for the said voyage, approved by Master and signed by all navigating officers. 

On 29 May, vessel was navigating through Taiwan Strait. Second Officer took over middle watch as OOW from Third Officer at 0005hrs on 30 May. Second Officer signed the Master’s night order and continued the bridge watch with duty AB. All navigation equipments were working in good order. The vessel was on auto steering and AB was on look out duty. ‘S’ band Radar was in operation at 06nm range, relative motion, Off- Centre, North up mode and ‘X’ band Radar was on ‘stand by’. ECDIS was also in use as secondary means of navigation. 

The weather experienced was North Easterly gentle breeze of force 3 (7-10knots) on Beaufort scale. The visibility was 2- 3nm due to fog. Fog signal was sounded.  

There was shipping and fishing traffic around. The own vessel at this time was on course 048˚T at 13.7knots, overtaking another vessel on her starboard side. The next alteration point of course 051˚T was expected at 0018hrs. 

At about 0035hrs, the duty AB saw the port sidelight and both mast head lights of a vessel, 2 points on starboard bow at an approximate distance of 2nm, he reported this to Second Officer, the OOW. VHE communication on ch16 was attempted by OOW for this target vessel. On not getting any response, OOW tried to track the target vessel on Radar. OOW was almost for 6minutes unable to detect this target on Radar. By this time the vessel had approached at about 2 cables on starboard bow slightly forward of beam, crossing from starboard to port on course 270˚T - 280˚T at 9.0knots. 

On seeing vessel so close, the OOW first made small alteration on auto pilot and then asked duty AB to do manual steering with helm to ‘starboard 10’, followed by ‘hard a starboard’ at 00:44:40hrs. The vessel began swinging to starboard. At 00:45hrs he ordered wheel amidships but the vessel was still swinging rapidly to starboard. At 00:45:10hrs, the helm to port 20 was ordered to which AB responded immediately. The vessel was now heading on 065˚T at 13.7knots.

At 00:45:30hrs the data obtained from VDR of “Hanjin Ningbo” showed that the vessel was heading on course 067˚T at 11.7knots, had collision with China registered mini bulk carrier ‘Fu Xin 98’ in position 24º 39.05´N 119º 05.20E, off Guangzhou, Taiwan Strait. 

The bulbous bow of container vessel ”Hanjin Ningbo” had collided with the port side hull of mini bulk carrier “Fu XIN 98” and both vessels were interlocked.  


On feeling the impact of collision, Master immediately reached on bridge, ordered ‘stop engine’ and helm to ‘amidships’. All deck lights were switched on. At 0050hrs the vessel was on a course 022ºT at 02.1 knots, both vessels drifting, interlocked with each other.  

Required assistance to the crew on board other vessel was provided and they were safely rescued.

Master carried out the formalities required for collision occurrence and informed concerned authorities.

Both vessels were sailing into the Flensburg Firth. Due to the prevailing westerly winds, the NOBILE tacked close to the wind. After tacking north of the Holnis Peninsula, the NOBILE approached the WERKER on northerly courses. The WERKER was following the fairway on westerly courses. Adequate measures to address the emerging risk of collision were not taken on either vessel. During the collision, the NOBILE's bow rammed the WERKER on her port side. The NOBILE's bowsprit struck an excavator parked on the deck of the WERKER and snapped. Due to a second impact abaft, the hull of the WERKER was damaged below the waterline and she took on water. The crew of the WERKER responded to this by grounding her on a shoal near the scene of the collision. After the collision, the NOBILE also anchored in the vicinity.","Other Activities Ships","Ship rendered unfit to proceed","234","[Other]","","","3","0","0","","","","","","","2020-05-29",""

Grand Future was berthing at West Shore Berth no.2, Roberts Bank and all hands on deck were on standby to send the first line shore.
During the Mooring operation, four crew members (2/O, A/B(B), O/S(A), Deck Cadet) were lowering the 02 aft spring lines manually (by hand) from forward of the combination and pilot ladder with line on shore pulling the heaving line attached to the mooring ropes. A/B(A) and O/S(B) were assisting in lowering the ropes as lookout standing from aft of the combination and pilot ladder and Boatswain was operating the mooring winch situated between no.8 and no.9 cargo hold.
As the four crew members started to lower the lines and when the lines were about to reach the shore wharf, crew members were suddenly losing control of the ropes due to the weight of the mooring rope and the pull of the lines men shore. As the crew members could not control the release of the rope which gained downward momentum and decided to let go lines and four crews shouted out each other to keep clear. Eventually the rope slipped from their hands as it was sliding downward toward the pier rapidly and fall out to the water. 
A/B(A) who was stationed aft of the combination ladder was hit by rope in his elbow and was thrown overboard by its force.  His legs hit the side of the protection dolphin and hands hit the post of dolphin mooring and then fall into the water.
Immediately 2/O throws a life ring. He was conscious and was able to swim and hold the side of protection dolphin (section 1.4.3).
The three linesmen on shore rushed to help him by going down using the ladder of the mooring dolphin post and try to hoist him up. But due to difficult position, they were unable to hoist the A/B(A) as they thought it might compromise his safety. Finally, they rescued him by using a small boat from the stevedores. 
At 1540Hrs LT ambulance arrived and gave him medical First Aid and was brought to the hospital for check up.  As per latest Information from the Hospital he has a broken right wrist and laceration on both legs but in a stable and good condition (section 1.4.7).

(NTC-4) CHITTAGONG PORT, BANGLADESH","1","0","Collision","On 11th May 2014, MV STAR OF LUCK completed loading of cargo at 06:18 am. At 06:30 am she confirmed readiness of main engines with all navigational equipment in satisfactory working condition (ref. SOM 03-01) and complied with Pre-Sailing Checklist (ref. SOM 03-01). Since then in all respect vessel was ready to sail out from Chittagong, Bangladesh for her next port of call, Singapore.
At 07:48 am the pilot (outbound) boarded and accordingly the master/pilot information exchange checklist (ref. SOM 05-02) was complied with. Vessel started singling up at 07:54 am and casted off (discarded) from Jetty No-6 of Chittagong port. Third officer was the officer of watch (OOW) while AB on wheel. At 08:12 am vessel was well cleared off jetty and gradually picked up speed while maneuvering through mid of the channel. At this moment, there was an inbound vessel named “KOTA WASITA” 3.5 miles away and approaching through the channel. 
The sea was moderate in condition but the visibility was poor. Both X and S band RADARs with ARPA were in operation. One of the RADAR was on 0.75 nautical mile range and being continuously monitored by OOW (3rd officer).  The other ARPA/RADAR was under the observation by master himself. VHF listening/watch was maintained on channels 16 and 12.  GPS was operational and used for position fixing. 
AIS was in operation but not monitored. Though the course recorder was operational but unfortunately it was not used as the OOW forgot to switch on. It was reported that engine telegraph logger was out of order since April 2014. S-VDR was kept on but it was showing an alarm massage since 31st March 2014. 

On the river road, in the western bank, there is a critical bend called Durgar Char where main base of Bangladesh Navy is situated. Numerous naval vessels are moored always. Due to the geographic bend and the traffic caused by naval ships, this place is always avoided for crossing, passing and overtaking between inbound and outbound vessels under pilotage.

At 08:19 am vessel “STAR OF LUCK” was in position 22⁰18.33ʹ N and 091⁰48.139ʹ E with engines
 on ‘half ahead’ while the inbound vessel ‘KOTA WISATA’ in position 22⁰16.229ʹ N and 091⁰49.39ʹ E made the distance between two vessels approximately 2.5 nautical miles and the critical bend of Durgar Char was equally one nautical mile away from both the vessels.

Due to the critical nature of the bend, the pilot of “STAR OF LUCK” planned to pass the inbound vessel after crossing this Durgar Char bend so as to keep safe distance from naval ships moored. As to execute agreed plan, the pilot suggested engines on full ahead at 08:20 am. Accordingly vessel picked up speed and at 08:23 am, the speed was recorded 9.6 knots while she was en-route along the center of the channel. 
At this stage, suddenly heavy rain patches with strong onshore breeze had been encountered by the vessel “STAR OF LUCK”. The rain fall was so dense that visibility became very poor. As the pilot lost the sight of naval vessels at the western part of the critical bend at Durgar Char, he decided not to proceed further ahead but to slow down. Accordingly pilot stopped engines at 08:24 am.
As soon as the propulsion was stopped, she started losing control. Strong cross current caught her bow and compelled to move to starboard while vessel was in full momentum.  So as to reduce her speed, within a few seconds of stopping engines, pilot put the engines on full astern and bow-thruster ‘full’ to port to prevent bow to turn to starboard. But, right handed propeller while turning for full astern caused further turning to starboard which was also accelerated by strong cross current. As pilot failed to prevent turning of bow to starboard, he decided to drop anchor and immediately ordered ‘let go port anchor’. 
Due to heavy rain Boson and Chief Officer who were stand by as anchor party at the forward station, were not exactly at the anchor station. They took shelter under the shed of number one bay on main deck, close to anchor station. The walk-talky was kept under the raincoat to protect damage from rain. As a result the anchor party failed to listen first order for ‘let go port anchor’. As there was no execution of the first order despite several shouts, pilot ordered to let go starboard anchor. 
Even after repeated calling, the master/pilot failed to reach the anchor party; which caused delay in letting go anchor. Finally when they received the orders, the vessel was almost to hit jetty; she was merely closed by 10 to 15 meter away from the jetty NCT-4. However, at 08:26 am vessel STAR OF LUCK could drop the starboard anchor. But it was too late to reduce the momentum. 
The anchor could not hold the vessel’s momentum because of very short distance and the speed that the vessel gained and finally she banged jetty NCT 4 at 08:27 am. There was a container vessel named mv. RICKMERS MUMBAI moored at jetty NCT-3. She was escaped hitting by very short distance.

The lifeboat was lowered into the water with no crew on board. Four crew members then boarded the lifeboat and manoeuvred it around the harbour for 10 minutes before connecting it back to the retrieval davit. A purpose-built lifting sling made up of four wire rope pennants was used to connect the lifeboat to the retrieval davit. Once the crew were seated with their restraints fastened, hoisting the lifeboat from the water commenced. The lifeboat had been hoisted to about deck level when first one and then the remaining three wire pennants parted and the lifeboat fell several metres back into the sea.  Meanwhile, one of the crew members had released his restraints in anticipation of disembarking the lifeboat. He was thrown clear of his seat and sustained a cut to the head, requiring overnight hospitalisation. None of the other three crew members was seriously injured. The lifeboat was undamaged.
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission of New Zealand found that the wire pennants parted under tensile overload because they had all been significantly weakened by severe corrosion. Corrosion had gone undetected inside a plastic sheathing that the manufacturer of the lifting sling had placed around the wire pennants.","General Cargo Ship","Serious injuries","20949","China Classification Society (CCS)","28451","Logs","","","","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","2015-04-08",""

The vessel sailed from Houston, USA on 3 April 2014, carried a cargo of 44,199.925 metric tones of Propane gas bound for Barcadera, Aruba.

On that day, at 1600 hours, (ship zone time), the Bosun and an AB were on routine day work. The Bosun, on his own initiative, took an empty 200-litre methanol drum and tried to cut it into two parts (2 halfs) with the help of an AB, to make it into two garbage containers. On board the vessel, it was a normal practice to recycle empty 200-litre luboil and methanol drums and cut them into two parts from the middle of the drum to use them as garbage bins. This was especially so with empty lub-oil drums. 

The Master said that according to the ship’s safe practice, it was a normal practice that the empty lub-oil drums would be washed inside with sea water to get rid of any remnant of lub-oil in the drum. In this instance, the Bosum mistook the empty 200-litre methanol drum as a lub-oil drum and wanted to make it as a garbage bin by cutting it into two halfs. According to the Bosun, he was not aware that it was an empty methonol drum and was not free of explosive vapour which still remained inside the drum. He could not see any marking outside the drum to indicate that it was an empty methanol drum.

The Bosun with the assistance of an AB, took the empty methnol drum to the Bosun workshop at the poop deck. With a chisel and a hammer, he tried to cut it into two parts at the middle. At the instance he cut it at the centre of the drum, there was a small burst of explosion at one end of the drum which tore open. The sharp edge cut the right leg of the AB who was holding on that end of the drum. Fortunately, it was not a serious cut and first aid was applied immediately to the wound. He was also sent for medical treatment when the vessel arrived at the port of Aruba.

The leak occurred while the vessel was near the South-Western shores of Newfoundland, Canada.
The leak was caused by a break-down of the suction valve of the lower sea chest, while the cover strainer was opened for cleaning and to remove the ice clogging it.
The situation became dire when a significant volume of sea water entered the vessel and pressure increased from the sea chest. Consequently, massive flooding occurred and the engine room was evacuated. This resulted in the ship’s loss of its own propulsion, electric power, steerage and manoeuvrability and the ship went adrift.
The Canadian Coast Guard attempted to reach the drifting cargo vessel on the afternoon of March 15th 2014, after the ship had lost power. However, the crew aboard the CCG were unable to intercept the 180-metre bulk carrier before it ran aground1.6 kilometres off Rose Blanche Newfoundland, around 1:30 p.m.
A Cormorant helicopter was dispatched and removed all 23 people aboard the John 1. They were taken to Burgeo Newfoundland just after 4 p.m. Saturday.

On 04 December 2013, the first of a series of wire rope failures was detected. 

On 13 March 2014, while the vessel was at St. Georges, Grenada, the crew members were carrying out a routine inspection of tender boat no. 12.  During the inspection, a wire strand in the aft travelling wire rope was found broken. 

Pending wire rope replacement, the damaged strand was temporarily secured by the crew to prevent it from spinning and opening up. 

Tender boat no. 12 was inspected again on 26 March 2014, at Castries in St. Lucia.  While extending out the UDSP davit, a cracking sound was heard.  The crew detected three damaged strands from the forward travelling wire rope.  The damaged section of the wire rope was intractable and strained to pass through the davit sheaves. 

The travelling wires on lifeboat no. 12 were eventually replaced on 22 and 28 March 2014. 

On 30 March 2014, at Rousseau, Dominica, the crew heard a cracking sound upon extending out the UDSP davit arms of lifeboat no. 5.  On further examination, three strands from the forward travelling wire rope were found severely damaged.  It was also noticed that the wire rope was rigid and difficult to pull through the davits sheave. 

Following the incident, the travelling wires of all the lifeboats and tender boats were examined by a certified shore contractor at La Romana, Dominica on 04 April 2014. 

The examination revealed four broken wire rope strands on the aft travelling wire of lifeboat no. 11. A recommendation was made to replace all lifeboat davits’ travelling wires.","Passenger Ship","Ship remains fit to proceed","77302","Lloyd's Register (LR)","9600","","807","1912","0","","","","","","","2017-04-01",""

Several vessels responded to the call and HMS Tyne proceeded to the scene to provide assistance.
Salvage pumps were put on board from both of the lifeboats and the helicopter, but the water level in Sea Breeze’s engine room could not be controlled. Following reports of water ingress into the cargo hold all six crew abandoned Sea Breeze onto the Falmouth lifeboat.

When the ship started to drift by bow, it was given the command to swerve hard to starboard and to be given more power to the engine, in order to regain control. Having failed, while was imminent a collision with the Northern Pier, the captain gave order to engage the engine to reverse the entire force. However, it was not possible to avoid the collision in the north jetty's rocks. While retreating, it were felt some ""jumps"" of the ship by the crew. After the collision, the ship continued to go backwards under its own power.

All pre-sailing tests were carried out and all equipment and machinery were found to be in working condition and ready to sail.

The pilot boarded the vessel at 1006 hours LT and proceeded to conduct the Master/Pilot Exchange. The pilot informed the Master that the minimum depths in the area around the berth were 17 metres and that the turning basin near the berth had been dredged about six (6) months prior, with minimum depths of 17 metres as well.

At 1024 hours LT the tugboat SWITZER OWL was made fast aft, with the tug´s lines, through the centre lead. At 1030 hours LT the tugboat DIAMOND CAY was made fast on the starboard shoulder, also using the tug´s lines. At approximately 1032 hours LT the MV MIRAERO BRAVE entered the channel, passing buoys 1 and 2.

At 1100 hours LT, whilst approaching the Ship Yard Dock the vessel grounded, at Latitude 26º 31.900 north and Longitude 078º 45.410 West in the Inner Harbour area, near the Floating Dock. Once the vessel grounded, the Master ordered the vessel´s engine stopped. The tugboats remained tied up to the vessel, but were ordered not to pull the vessel, or in any way move the vessel in order to refloat her. All necessary emergency procedures were followed in order to preserve the vessel´s seaworthiness and to prevent any pollution. All equipment and machinery were inspected and found to be in working condition.

Harbour Control was notified and as a result two senior pilots boarded the vessel at about 1124 hours LT. The Harbour Office also contacted divers to conduct an underwater survey, which was finished at about 1348 hours LT. At the same time, the vessel´s officer took soundings around the vessel, which confirmed that the vessel was hard aground over a small area, forward of amidships.

At about 1348 hours LT, because of the effect of the incoming tide, the vessel was refloated without having to pull her off the bottom, minimizing the damage to the hull of the vessel. Once the vessel was able to proceed on her own power, the pilots took her outside the Inner Harbour and disembarked at about 1436 hours LT. The vessel was anchored again, under the control of the Master, at 1448 hours LT.

The outbound MV NYK Themis, transiting south-easterly from Keppel Harbour, collided with the unmanned AZ Fuzhou, towed alongside by the drifting (dragging anchor) easterly heading AZ Carnation.

Earlier, VTM East Control informed the Pilot about AZ Carnation, towing AZ Fuzhou, dragging anchor and drifting west of the Main Fairway buoy. The Pilot, with the Master’s implied approval, decided to pass between the Main Fairway buoy and AZ Carnation on his port and starboard sides respectively.

Subsequently, the Pilot increased speed and made a small port alteration (to the east) to cross the bow of AZ Carnation as he assumed it was a conventional tug and tow (tow astern of tug) when it was actually towing alongside - AZ Fuzhou protruding some 50m beyond the starboard bow of AZ Carnation. Apparently, the Pilot and NYK Themis bridge team saw the navigation lights exhibited by AZ Carnation but not the port (red) sidelight of AZ Fuzhou.

Moments before the incident, the Pilot and bridge team saw AZ Fuzhou fine on the starboard bow. Despite hard port helm, it was to no avail as the starboard hull of NYK Themis collided with the port bow of AZ Fuzhou.

There were no reported injuries but both vessels sustained material damages; AZ Fuzhou sustained bow damages while the No. 5(S) Fuel Oil Tank of NYK Themis was breached, spilling an estimated 402 mt of heavy fuel oil.

MPA activated the oil spill contingency plan and co-ordinated the containment and clean-up efforts. As at 3 February 2014, no more oil patches were reported. During this period, there was no disruption to traffic and port operations remained unaffected.

It appeared that the main causal factor was due to the human error of lack of perception – when the Pilot did not realised there was a developing close-quarters situation but assumed it was business as usual with a drifting tug and tow in the vicinity.
	Contributory causal factors include AZ Carnation being unfit to safely perform its intended task, the Master of NYK Themis displaying the human error of inadequate situational awareness and MPA organisational issue in terms of the lack of a SOP to handle scenarios of drifting navigational hazard.

This incident also highlights the need to consider enlarging the definition of competence to include attitude (affective domain) i.e. to analyse and help explain the whys of not taking early avoiding actions, of being complacent, of relying on unfounded assumptions etc.

Among others, the safety recommendations include encouraging ship owners to voluntarily implement competence in BTM and BRM, MPA to consider implementing a SOP to handle scenarios of drifting navigational hazard and PSA Marine Pte Ltd to consider sponsoring a study to include the affective domain as another component of the competency framework for Pilots.

The outbound MT Lime Galaxy, proceeding from the LNG/LPG/Chemical Gas Carrier Anchorage to (pilot) Disembarkation Ground 9 (DG9) off Tuas Reclamation Area, collided with the inbound MV Fei He, proceeding from (pilot) Western Boarding Ground A to Pasir Panjang Terminal.

There was no reported injuries but both vessels sustained material damages; Lime Galaxy sustained bow damages while the No. 6(P) Fuel Oil Tank of Fei He was breached, spilling an estimated 281 mt of intermediate fuel oil.

MPA activated the oil spill contingency plan and co-ordinated the containment and clean-up efforts. As at 3 February 2014, no more oil patches were reported. During this period, there was no disruption to traffic and port operations remained unaffected.
Investigations revealed that both vessels were headed towards a close-quarters situation due to the human error of lack of situational awareness, in particular, the unfounded assumption by the Pilot of Lime Galaxy, having Fei He on the starboard side, that the stand-on Fei He would alter and pass astern of Lime Galaxy.

Contributory causal factors include Fei He not proceeding at a safe speed, Lime Galaxy bridge team unaware that the vessel was not proceeding directly to DG9 and both bridge teams not fully implementing the principles of Bridge Team Management (BTM) and Bridge Resource Management (BRM).

The PACIFIC ORCA was sailing from Eemshaven in the Netherlands to the Borkum Riffgrund 1 wind farm laden with the foundations for wind turbines. She departed from Eemshaven on the prior evening. The fishing vessel was sailing back to Eemshaven after a six-day fishing voyage in the North Sea.
After crossing the Terschelling-German Bight traffic separation scheme at right angles, the PACIFIC ORCA altered her course from 350° to 048° to starboard in the direction of the wind farm about eight and a half minutes before the collision. After having completed the navigational course alteration the PACIFIC ORCA was on a collision course with the JURIE VAN DEN BERG, which was proceeding on a southerly course. The evasion manoeuvres initiated on both vessels later on did not succeed in preventing the collision. Both vessels sustained material damage. There were neither personal injuries nor environmental pollution.

The ship arrived at Brunsb ttel under pilotage in the early hours of the morning. Since only limited operation of the Kiel Canal locks was possible due to technical problems, she had to first lie in an anchorage off Brunsb ttel for an extended period. The ship's command and pilot opted for a position in the Nordwest-Reede anchorage, where the WES JANINE anchored between the STENBERG and RIJNBORG at 0200<#_ftn1>. The ship rotated up until about 0345 due to the turning of the tide. The WES JANINE's pilot continued to monitor the behaviour of the ship until 0356 and then left the bridge. The WES JANINE started to drift at anchor at about 0450. The officer on the bridge in charge of the navigational watch did not notice this initially or there was no appreciable response. The pilot was not requested to go to the bridge until 0518, at which point the distance to the STENBERG was 80 m. The convergence was not noticed on the STENBERG until even later. The two ships had converged even further when the main engine was started on the WES JANINE. As a result of this, the STENBERG's anchor cable was caught by and then blocked the WES JANINE's screw. The WES JANINE then drifted further towards the STENBERG and the two ships collided. The bow of the STENBERG sustained minor damage in the process. Three containers and the hull was dented on the WES JANINE. Attempts were initially made to separate the two ships with the help of a tug. This was not possible. The STENBERG later slipped her ground tackle, i.e. the anchor and chain, and was then able to continue her voyage. The WES JANINE was later moved back to the anchorage with the help of two tugs, during which manoeuvring was severely impaired by having to drag the STENBERG's ground tackle. The WES JANINE was towed to a shipyard for repair work sometime after.
Nobody lost their life or was injured as a result of the collision between the two ships and no environmentally hazardous substances escaped.","Liquefied Gas Tanker","Ship remains fit to proceed","11935","[Other]","16600","","16","0","0","","","","","","","2018-01-11",""

The voyage was a dangerous goods voyage with a limited number of passengers on board. With a limitation of the number of passengers the vessel was able to transport dangerous goods to a greater extent. On board were 188 passengers and 39 crew, as well as trucks, trailers and cars. The weather conditions were darkness, with good visibility, light northerly current and south by southeasterly wind of about 10-11 m/s. The fairway into Oskarshamn passes the buoyed Grimskalleleden and then turns almost 40 and continues down to the harbour and Ovdersuddens leading line. When the ship approached Oskarshamn the OOW navigated under the supervision of the master. The big turn was initiated by the OOW with the speed of 14 knots using the autopilot and a preset turning radius of 0.3 nm. The autopilot was set in heading mode , which meant that the drift was to be corrected manually. The first green buoy after the turn was passed as planned on the ship's starboard side, however somewhat closer to the buoy and a little beyond the intended route plan. At this moment, the master took over the steering and engine control on the starboard bridge wing, which in this case meant that the master himself was steering the vessel by hand and that the autopilot was disengaged. Shortly thereafter the OOW said to the master ""she is drifting a bit"" and the master replied promptly, ""I see that"". Katygrund was passed closely on the starboard side of the vessel. The master had from his position on the starboard bridge wing lookout aft and laid starboard rudder with the intention to lift the stern of the vessel away from Katygrund before the aft part of the vessel had completely passed the buoy. When also the stern had passed Katygrund the master looked forward and felt that the next green buoy was straight ahead. Then he put the rudder to port and crossed the engines in order to try getting the ship on the correct side of the buoy. Shortly thereafter the master saw the green buoy disappear in under the vessel in the area of L/2 (half the length of the ship). The ship ran aground at 7:41 PM. At that time, no one on the bridge noticed that the ship had run aground. The crew in the engine room immediately understood that the ship had run aground. The 2 engineer noticed that dry tank 7 was flooded and bilge pumping was immediately initiated. At that time there were five persons from the crew in the engine room, which facilitated and speeded up the leakage control. The investigation has found that the cause of the accident was that bridge routines had been developed where the taking over of the control of the ship was done at the bridge wings during the last part of navigation into Oskarshamn. Contributing factors were that the navigation stations were not equipped with hand steering and there were deficiencies in, and differences between the used route planning and the route planning in the ISM-manual. Other factors were that there was no log or wind indicator at the working stations on the bridge wings. The investigation has also found that there is a limited exchange of experiences about navigating in narrow fairways between nautical officers in the company but also between the company's nautical officers and nautical officers of other shipping companies. Furthermore, the investigation has noted that there are possibilities to develop the guidelines of the ISM-manual regarding the division of the workload between pilot and co-pilot when navigating in narrow fairways.
