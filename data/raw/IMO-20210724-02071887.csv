Before arrival a port side lifeboat drill was scheduled to take place immediate following the arrival and under the command of the chief officer.

At 0715 the lifeboat was ready for launching. 7 crew members were on board the lifeboat and were fastened in their seatbelt. The boat was lowered to a position level with the boat deck, and at that point the hoisting function was tested. The winch motor did not hoist and the drill was therefore abandoned and an attempt was made to hoist the boat by hand. In order to investigate the cause the electrician was sent down to the HI-press room, where the electrical panel board of the davit motor is located. By pushing different contacts at the panel board the winch motor could be brought to hoist in jerks.

Suddenly the winch started to hoist steady and fast and continued hoisting after the davits had reached their uppermost position. Due to the continued pull the wires broke and the boat fell 16 metres down to the sea. One of the crew members was so seriously injured, that he died shortly after, 3 other crew members were seriously injured and the remaining 3 crew members sustained light to moderate injuries.

The investigations following the accident has shown, that by pushing the contacts at the panel board the Proximity Cut-off Switches at the davits, which cut off the current for the winch motor just before the davits reaches their stop position, and the Over Current Control Relay, which cut off the current for the winch motor in case of overload, were bypassed.

The investigation revealed that the vessel's master had fallen asleep and surmised that fatigue was the major causal factor contributing to this casualty. Prior to leaving the discharge port, the Master had assisted in the loading and securing of the barge's containers and had only gotten two hours of sleep prior to departing port.

No pilot was onboard as the local Authorities had given permission to the vessel's Captain to enter the port without a pilot. Heavy fog was present at the time and the sea was calm. No equipment failure was reported.
At the time of the grounding the Captain was alone on the bridge. He intended to sail through the narrow gap between Kinnestabben and Kjoertingen. Whilst performing a manoeuvre to correct his course, the Captain reported that the wheel reacted slower than normal. He did not manage to correct his course on time and the vessel hit the rocky Kinnestabben with port side bottom and damaged the lighthouse with starboard side.

The vessel was bound for Wallaroo to lad a cargo of wheat. AMARANTOS arrived at the anchorage off Port Wallaroo on 6 April. On 10 April the pilot embarked on AMARANTOS and the vessel headed towards its berth. Two tugs were employed to assist in the manoeuvring. 

The approach to the jetty in Wallaroo proceeded normally. When the vessel was about 200m off the jetty, drifting slowly and approaching at almost right angles to it, the pilot ordered half astern to slow the vessel down and swing it round to berth alongside the jetty. When the vessel was about 150m off the jetty and still at right angles to it, the pilot reported to have realised that the half astern movement was having little effect on the speed of the ship. So he ordered full astern and also full power to the two tugs to swing the ship round. The time of his order was about 0718.

These orders still made little progress in slowing down and swinging the ship round. When the ship was about 70m away from the jetty, the master reported to have taken initiative himself and ordered emergency full astern. However, at 0720 the vessel made contact with the Wallaroo jetty and grain loader. The AMARANTOS suffered little superficial damage. However the grain loader superstructure and jetty suffered substantial damage.
