While passing abeam San Nicolas Light, she reported to VTMS Corregidor her entry to the start of the northern lane of the Corregidor South Channel in going out of Manila Bay, as required under the rules of passage in the Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) of the Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) and the Ships' Routeing regulation of the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG). In navigating southwesterly out of Manila Bay along the northern lane of the South Channel, she has to pass south of Corregidor Island and further navigate in a southwesterly direction to reach her destination in Tilik to disembark her 63 passengers who will spend the night before Christmas (“noche buena“) with their families. F/V Anatalia DR, a 1972-built 369.28 gross tons steel-hulled fishing vessel owned by Philmariner Aqua Ventures Corp., on the other hand, has last come from a port in Puerto Princesa City, Palawan enroute to the fishing grounds in the southern part of the country to load fish into her cargo hatches from her company's smaller vessel catchers in the fishing grounds, and to later transport the fishcatch cargo to Navotas Fishport inside Manila Bay. She, therefore, has to go up and enter Manila Bay passing through Corregidor South Channel enroute to Navotas Fishport. Under the rules of passage, she has to pass through the southern lane of the Corregidor South Channel. 
The ships' routing regulation provides that foreign vessels entering Manila Bay shall pass through the southern lane of the Corregidor North Channel while foreign vessels exiting the bay shall pass through the northern lane of the Corregidor North Channel. On the other hand, the Corregidor South Channel is intended for the use of domestic vessels with those entering Manila Bay passing through the southern lane and those exiting the bay passing through the northern lane which was the lane traversed rightly by M/V Catalyn B and traversed in counterflow by F/V Anatalia DR. 
The Master of M/V Catalyn B, Tony Faminia, stated during the hearing that his vessel was on course 215 degrees and speed of 8.3 knots (nautical miles per hour) while going southwesterly along the northern lane of the Corregidor South Channel TSS and has altered his course to 220 degrees which was his next waypoint intending to leave the traffic lane and to proceed headed for Tilik prior to the collision. Immediately prior to the collision, M/V Catalyn B maneuvered hard to starboard to avoid F/V Anatalia DR that continued crossing her bow. The collision occurred while both vessels were still inside the outbound lane. The Master of F/V Anatalia, during the hearing, stated that he has come from a course of 048 degrees coming from Cape Calavite and upon reaching Golo Light, has changed his course to 009 degrees which was his next way point up, intending to change course again after passing abeam Limbones Island enroute to Navotas Fishport disregarding the TSS. F/V Anatalia did not have the appropriate NAMRIA Chart No. 4255 on Manila Bay and its approaches where the TSS is clearly indicated. She has traversed through the northern lane (outbound) of the Corregidor South Channel of the TSS, thus sailing upward on a counterflow towards the path of M/V Catalyn B that was on her starboard side and which was then navigating southwesterly at the northern lane and intending to leave the traffic lane headed for Tilik while on course 220 degrees. With the vessels' track and site of the collision derived from the records provided by the VTMS Center of the Philippine Ports Authority (PPA), it was established that the two vessels had a prior crossing situation, making the F/V Anatalia DR as the give-way vessel and the M/V Catalyn B as the stand-on vessel. M/V Catalyn B was clearly coming from Manila Bay and necessarily, was moving southwesterly in proceeding to her destination in Tilik, Lubang, Mindoro following her usual route. F/V Anatalia DR, on the other hand, was clearly coming from the south and was going up and was the vessel on the port side of M/V Catalyn B. Crossing situation, however, cannot be assumed unless both vessels are in sight of one another. Considering their vessels' lengths in the vessel certificates issued by the Maritime Industry Authority (MARINA) of both being less than 50 meters, their vessel side lights should have a visibility of two (2) nautical miles and the masthead lights of five (5) nautical miles. Visibility in the accident area during the incident was about three (3) nautical miles with good weather and generally calm sea.

As the vessel left the harbour limits the engines were set to ""full away"" and the crew set about reconfiguring the 440 volt switchboard.  No1 generator was started and as the supply breaker was about to be closed, it self closed out of phase.  This caused Nos 2 and 3 generator supply breakers to open, resulting in a blackout situation.  The emergency generator started automatically and restored the expected limited electrical supplies.

The chief engineer, who had recently joined the vessel, set about trying to locate the electrical fault which had caused the blackout.  In the meantime the main engine temperatures started to increase above the normal running temperature of 90 deg C because the main electrically driven sea water cooling pumps had stopped as these were not supplied from the emergency generator.  The engine temperatures continued to increase and at 95 deg C the engine control system automatically reduced the engine power in an attempt to lower the temperatures.  However, the engines very quickly reached the upper temperature limit of 98 deg C at which time the control system stopped the engine, as designed, to prevent the risk of damage due to overheating.

As propulsive power was lost, the master allowed the vessel to come to a stop in open water, at which time the anchor was dropped.

Within 7 minutes of the blackout the faulty supply breaker from No1 generator was racked out and Nos 2 and 3 generators started and connected to the distribution system restoring electrical supplies.  The engines were restarted and the vessel resumed her passage.  On arrival the faulty breaker was removed and replaced with a fleet spare.  No 1 generator and supply breaker were tested and proven to work satisfactorily.

The vessel is due in dry dock during mid January 2010 at which time the faulty breaker will be inspected and overhauled by the original equipment manufacturer.

Le vendredi 20 novembre 2009, le transbordeur Bretagne de la compagnie Brittany Ferries est amarré bâbord à quai au poste ferry de Millbay Docs  à Plymouth (Grande-Bretagne). Il est affecté à la ligne Roscoff-Plymouth et, conformément à l’horaire programmé, le navire a accosté à 18 :00 heures et est prévu appareiller à 22 :00 heures. A Plymouth, les embarquements et débarquements des véhicules se font par la porte avant, et par la porte arrière à Roscoff.

Entre la fin d débarquement, à 19 :00 heures et le début de l’embarquement des véhicules prévu à 20 :00 heures, la surveillance et la propreté du pont garage (pont 3) sont assurées par les deux matelots de quart.

Les ponts-garages des transbordeurs sont équipés de ventilateurs afin d’extraire les gaz d’échappement des véhicules. Ces ventilateurs fonctionnent essentiellement pendant les opérations commerciales. Ils ont été stoppés vers 19 :00 heures et redémarrées vers 19 :45 heures.

Vers 20 :00 heures, le maître d’équipage est sur place pour superviser l’embarquement des camions et remorques. L’un des matelots de quart lui montre une pièce métallique trouvée sur le pont.

Arrivé sur place, le chef mécanicien suppose que  la pièce  métallique trouvée sur le pont provient du ventilateur tribord arrière ; l’ordre est donné à la passerelle, où est situé le pupitre de contrôle, de stopper la ventilation. Lors de cette opération, la turbine du ventilateur tribord arrière, qui n’est pas protégée par une grille, tombe. Ses éléments constitutifs sont dispersés sur toute la partie tribord arrière du pont 3, du tambour central à la porte arrière.

Un matelot, qui se trouvait à environ 4 mètres de l’aplomb du ventilateur, est grièvement blessé au crâne. Vers 20 :35 heures, la victime est évacuée par l’ambulance vers l’hôpital Derriford de Plymouth

1.5 Difficulties were experienced with re-setting of the hooks to the locked position but with the assistance of the Bosun they were, after a number of trial resetting operations, secured in a state that was believed to be safe for hoisting.
1.6 The lifeboat had been hoisted to the stowed position when the after hook opened unexpectedly. This was followed by a similar opening of the forward hook and the boat fell to the water where it impacted in an inverted attitude.
1.7 The boat righted itself in the water but substantial damage had been inflicted on the upper works of the hull. Minor holing identified as contact with the davit had also occurred to the hull.
1.8 The three seafarers in the boat sustained serious injuries.
1.9 Damage to the boat was substantial and included a detachment of the internally mounted buoyancy tanks from the overhead shell of the boat. The port tank fell down and is believed to be responsible for some of the injuries sustained by the
seafarers.

The remaining upper four containers in each stack remained locked together by twist locks until it was time to discharge the bay they occupied.  At 04.20 during discharge and loading operations, the containers in bay 26 toppled to port resulting in the loss of 18 containers overboard.  It was subsequently found that top containers in 7 of the 9 stacks which were shown on the plan as empty, actually had contents ranging between 15 and 30 tonnes.  A main fire main was damaged which required class approved repairs before the ship could sail.

The preliminary examination of the accident found that the inaccurate container weights were on the loading plan because of a system shortcoming which did not update the operations department when the shipper provided more accurate contents details to the carrier.  The trigger that caused the containers to collapse is unclear, but structural failure of a container has not been ruled out.

The Polish third engineer took the 04.00 - 12.00 engine room watch and at about 08.10 he decided to clean the control room windows that gave a view into the engine room.

Once he had finished cleaning the inside of the windows he moved into the engine room to clean the outside.  Access was difficult and so instead of using a long handled cleaner he opted to stand with his right foot on the step of a ladder accessing the lower floor plates and with his left foot on a 4cm flat steel extension bar welded to the front of the control room bulkhead.  His right hand grasped a small bore pipe also fitted to the control room bulkhead.  

As he steadied himself his left foot slipped off the flat steel bar.  He lost his balance and he let go of the pipe.

The engineer slipped over the ladder handrails and fell 3 metres onto the lower floor plates, landing heavily onto his left side.  He lost consciousness for about 1-2 minutes after which he managed to struggle back to the control room from where he contacted the bridge and told the officer of the watch of the accident.  The chief mate and the bosun were alerted and found the engineer sitting in a chair in the control room.  He had suffered cuts to his head which were cleaned.  He was relieved of his watch and landed ashore and repatriated to Poland where it was discovered that he had also suffered a hairline crack of his left hip bone. He was advised to take 2 weeks off work.

The third engineer's assessment of the risks of the cleaning task was inadequate.  He gave no thought to using an extendable/long handled cleaning implement or of using a safety harness, both of which were readily available.

The company are holding an ""Injury Panel"" on board the vessel when the circumstances of the accident will be discussed.  The master and chief engineer will be required to meet with the CEO of the company in November 2009 to discuss what actions the ship has taken to prevent a re-occurrence of this accident.

On October 12th, 2009 at approx. 0748lt (+4GMT) during cargo operations heavy smoke was spotted coming out from starboard side on the upper deck.    The weather at the time of the incident was clear skies with northerly winds of approximately force of 2 to 3 on the Beaufort scale.  At the moment of the incident the vessel was performing cargo operations alongside the berth at Port of Adabiya, Egypt.  The vessel had discharging cement and it was berthed port side to the berth. During cargo operations, the crew perform watch every 6 hours. The upper deck accommodates 27 persons and the watch personnel of the 12 to 6 watch just had started their rest period at the moment the fire started. 
The Captain was on his cabin and was alerted of the fire by the Chief Mate that went knocking on different doors to alert the Crew.  Approximately at 0750, the Captain ran to the bridge and sounded the general Alarm immediately which alerted the entire ship.  Other crew members went inside the main deck and other decks knocking at the doors of the different crew in order to alert them of the situation

The intention was to steam up to the end of the pier, stop, commence the turn to starboard and pivot the stem around the end of the pier using the bow thrust and a tug standing by on the starboard quarter to push up as required.  The pilot and the staff captain were positioned on the starboard bridge wing, distances were being called by the officer stationed on the forecastle.  Initially the focsle officer reported the stem to be swinging clear by about 20m and the rate of turn increased, however the second call advised that the stem would pass clear by about 7m, the message did not prompt the pilot to take any action.  A little while later the pilot ordered dead slow astern on the starboard engine.  The focsle officer then advised that the stem would not swing clear, the pilot took no action and the master then ordered half astern followed by full astern.  The stem made contact with the end of pier causing  damage to the jetty and extensive damage to the vessels stem.

The vessel sank in position 23º 02.2’ N 118º 08.11E. The cause of the sinking was due to the ingress of sea water into the cargo hold. The ship’s portable pumps failed and could not cope with the ingress of water in the hold. The vessel subsequently listed heavily to port and a freak wave hit her on the starboard side causing her to roll further to port, breaking the deck containers and some fell into the sea, before she subsequently sank.

The vessel therefore departed & proceeded to an anchorage position 0.8 miles north of the harbour breakwater. The master increased speed up to 11.7 kts & the fwd mooring party began to lower the starboard anchor to the water en route to the anchorage. Eight minutes into the passage, the master ordered midships helm and ordered the anchor be let go 2 minutes later; the vessel was now making 3.5 kts speed over ground (SOG) & course over ground (COG) 030°, and the heading had swung to stbd as the vessel started to slow with engines half astern.  The anchor was let go shortly after, with SOG 2 kts & COG 048°, and the vessel now lying across the tide (117° & 2kts), setting bodily to starboard across the anchor cable. The fwd mooring party paid out 4 cables of anchor chain & fully applied the brake, as requested by the bridge. Not long after that the mooring party reported the chain was at ""6 o'clock and tight"", with SOG now 0.7 kts & COG 068°, but a minute later the chain was reported as ""slacking"", with SOG 0.2 kts & COG 200°. A further minute after that, the chain was reported as ""up and down"" & the bridge requested the brake be applied, which was again fully applied & the stabiliser bar placed over the chain. The order to shut down the engines was made 15 minutes into the trip & was in the process of being carried out when the port stabiliser room bilge alarm sounded. The bridge was informed & the motorman deployed to the space, where he discovered a significant ingress of water. Both bilge pumps were engaged, but were unable to cope with the inflow of water which also cross flooded into the starboard stabiliser room, setting off the bilge alarm in that space.
The water level stabilised at the waterline, with an estimated 600 to 700 m3 of flood water, whilst adjacent compartments were monitored for ingress; watertight doors were however not ordered shut. The vessel returned to the berth later that evening & a diver's survey identified a jagged 300mm by 300mm penetration on the port side bottom shell turn of bilge plating iwo the port stabiliser room at the vessel's mid length. There was also evidence of paintwork/steel scoring extending 3m fwd of this hole, as well as indentation damage on the aft lower edge of the stbd anchor box.
The vessel was given a one trip dispensation for a voyage to a repair yard, where she was docked. The stabiliser hydraulic machinery, electrical control panels & other electrical items had all been submerged & damaged. Reports of minor pollution following the accident were not substantiated.
The anchorage seabed was sand over clay with no rock & a subsequent survey by the port authority identified no seabed obstructions iwo the anchorage. The most probable cause of the damage was due to the vessel moving forward over the anchor; when the cable became taut, the shank would have lifted to a vertical position. Although the echosounder was not being used prior to the accident, it subsequently indicated an underkeel clearance of 3m, whilst the length of the anchor shank was approximately 3.2m. There was also evidence of anti-fouling paint on the anchor shank top. The deployed four lengths of cable, would have given an overall length of 113m between the hawse pipe and the anchor, whilst the stabiliser compt was between 99 to 110m aft of the vessel's stem. Allowing for the catenary in the cable & angle between the hawse pipe to the keel this would have therefore corresponded with the location of the hull damage.

During the day time of 9 September 2009, the weather had deteriorated rapidly and winds reached force 8 from south east,  causing the ship to roll and pitch heavily. 
The master had already diverted the ship from an almost easterly heading to mitigate the ship’s movement because of the chief officer's concern about the stowage condition of a part lot of steel pipes in one of the lower holds in the tweendeck. Having handed over his navigational watch to the third mate at 20:00 hours, the chief mate informed the master about his intention to check on the cargo to locate the source of potential danger spots, and to re-secure pipe lashings, if essential. After a short period of time the chief officer returned to the bridge and reported to the master that all was in order. However, shortly thereafter he returned to the cargo hold, backed by the bosun and almost all deck crew, after strange noises audible from one hold had raised their concern. 
One and a half hours later the second  mate ran onto the bridge to inform the master about an accident that had happened down in the tweendeck where the chief officer together with  the deck crew had attempted to re-secure some loose pipes on top of the cargo pile.
After the master had put the ship into a quieter position a rescue team was assembled to render aid in the cargo hold. The chief mate and an OS were found jammed-in among moving pipes with their feet crushed between. The two men were carried to the ship's hospital. After thorough first aid had been rendered  by the master, with radio medical expertise consulted, both casualties were airlifted into a landside hospital by Halifax Rescue Center helicopter.

1.2 A number of factors contributed to his entrapment, in particular:
The Officer did not follow the recommended transit procedures when passing through a watertight door.
Company procedures for operation of watertight doors were not monitored or enforced.
1.3 There was no evidence of any malfunction of the watertight door.
1.4 VDR data indicated that a large majority of the opening and closing sequences of watertight doors in the engine room represented significantly less than the full travel of the door, and thus that the most personnel were passing through without the door fully open, and in at least some cases, the door would have been in motion at the time of passing through.
1.5 VDR data also indicated that many of the doors were routinely left open when navigating in confined waters, which could potentially compromise the watertight integrity of the vessel, in the event of an incident.
1.6 Following the M.V. Eurovoyager entrapment incident in November 2008, the UK Marine Accident Investigation Branch made recommendations to the Maritime and Coastguard Agency to “explore potential means of improving the safe use of powered watertight doors, through industry bodies such as the National Occupational Health and Safety Committee, taking into account ship crews’ apparent reluctance to observe existing guidelines, current technology and the need to keep watertight doors closed at sea” (MAIB 2009/150). The Bahamas Maritime Authority supports this
recommendation.
1.7 Recommendations have also been made to Fred Olsen Cruise Lines aimed at improving their crews’ compliance with the procedures for the operation of watertight doors within their fleet, and improved documentation of their training procedures.

The collision occurred in the precautionary area adjoining Traffic Separation Schemes in the Malacca Straits to the south west of Port of Dickson, Malaysia territorial waters.

The Ostende Max left Port Dickson at 1918 LMT after unloading all cargo. After crossing traffic in the NW bound TSS lane the Ostende Max was planning to join the SE bound TSS lane to head for its next port in Singapore for bunkering. The Ostende Max intended to alter course to a SE'ly heading in the Precautionary Area after allowing a group of SE bound vessels to pass ahead.

The Ostende Max was the Give Way vessel in a Crossing Situation as defined in the 'Colregs'. The Ostende Max did not take sufficient action to avoid collision in accordance with the 'Colregs' and collided with the port quarter of the 'Formosaproduct Brick'. The 'Formosaproduct Brick' made a minor adjustment off course to avoid collision but was hampered by other vessels in the vicinity.

The collision caused significant structural damage to the bow area of the Ostende Max and 3 members of crew sustained burn injuries from the scaring air temperature from the burning cargo in the sea spilled by the Formosaproduct Brick. A minor fire on the Fo'c'sle deck of the Ostende Max developed and was effectively extinguised by the ship's crew.","BULK CARRIER","Serious injuries,Ship rendered unfit to proceed","38489","","73207","","22","","","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","2012-02-14",""

The yacht was proceeding under sail on a westerly course towards Kiel with two people on board. Her skipper observed the departure of the ferry, but saw only her green sidelight up until the very last. Therefore, in spite of the approaching and planned close quarter situation, he was confident that the ferry would observe his right of way and realised they were on a collision course only second before the impact. Accordingly, he did not have sufficient time for the usual procedure in critical situations of illuminating his sail with spotlights and calling over VHF. The hazardous approach was only recognised just before the collision, at  the moment that the yacht was first identified visually, on the bridge of the ferry as well. In spite of the last-moment action initiated on each ship, there was not enough time left (approximately 30 seconds) until the collision to avoid the accident.
The fore section on the port side of the Mahdi was hit with considerable force by the bow of the ferry. The yacht heeled very quickly and heavily to starboard side of the ferry and righted herself after parting from the ferry. The skipper, who along with the female co-sailor did not suffer any injuries, managed to start the engine and put the bilge pump into operation.  
A general alarm was sounded on the Schleswig-Holstein and a lifeboat was lowered into the water. Contact between the crew of the lifeboat and the yacht revealed the people on board had survived the accident unhurt and that the yacht was still buoyant in spite of strong deformations on her outer skin. There was no environmental pollution.


A search and rescue ship, the Emil Zimmermann, and a Danish tug, the Baltsund, promptly sailed from Puttgarden to the scene of the accident. The Baltsund, accompanied by the search and rescue ship, then towed the yacht to Puttgarden.

As a result, light crude has been escaping to the ocean surface and gaseous hydrocarbons have also been released.

Initial estimates indicated that 64 tonnes per day (400 barrels) were being lost.  
A new rig is being dispatched from Singapore.  Once the new equipment has arrived, a jack-up drill will be used to drill a relief well to alleviate the pressure and to stem the flow of oil.  The leaking well will then be capped.  The work is expected to take four weeks to complete.

The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) is coordinating the response.  Dispersants are being routinely applied by air and from vessels, which has been successful in accelerating the dispersion of the oil.  Response and recovery vessels have also been dispatched for oil recovery.  The Department of Environment, Water, Heritage and Arts (DEWHA) is liaising with AMSA to provide advice on environmental priorities and has devised a wildlife response plan to address any wildlife affected by the spill.  There are particular concerns for the Ashmore Reef, near Cartier Islet.  Wildlife surveys and monitoring are being carried out.  While some wildlife has been affected, the impacts appear to be relatively low thus far.

Overflights have been undertaken daily throughout the period to identify patches of oil. Containment and recovery operations also continue.  Sheen is evident in scattered patches in a 20 nm radius around the platform.  However, there is evidence of some patches up to 30 nm from the platform.

First aid and resuscitation were given. A rescue helicopter carrying a doctor arrived after approximately 45 minutes, and after examining the leading seaman, he was declared dead.

There were no witnesses to the accident. It is possible that the leading seaman died due the injuries he sustained when he crawled up the ladder to exit the tank. The seaman was not using any kind of fall arrest systems.

At 1048 a message was sent to all ships in the area and also to the Maritime Rescue Centre.  The master turned the vessel back at full sea speed along the vessel's track to the position that the casualty was last seen, arriving at 2042.  The ship then commenced a single ship search assisted by Coastguard aircraft.

At 2212 the visibility had reduced to 0.1 mile and the search was called off and the ship resumed her scheduled passage.

The company's investigations identified that the casualty was a normal, quite person.  He was said to have been very friendly with his cabin mate and there were no indications of bad feeling towards him by any of the officers or crew and there was no reason to suspect foul play.  It was discovered that it was impossible to fall into the sea from ""B"" deck as a person would have landed on ""A"" deck, immediately below.  It was only possible to fall overboard from ""A"" deck.  Neither the casualty's cigarettes nor lighter were found.  The guard rails were found to be in good condition, however, because of night navigation requirements the lights around the accommodation were not switched on.

The reason for the casualty disappearing (probably overboard) was not identified.  However, there was evidence of alcohol being consumed and despite reassurances from the group attending the party that the casualty was not drunk, alcohol must be considered to have been a factor.

At the time of the collision two (2) pilots and three (3) tugs were assisting the vessel. 

The vessel was turning via astern 90° from the harbour channel into the basin E in each case one tug was connected forward and aft at the vessel. The third tug was pushing from the starboard side in way of the mid ship area.

The Captain realised, whilst turning into the basin, that the bow of the MERIT was coming very close to the bow of a big container vessel which was laid up in the canal at the opposite side of the harbour basins.

At the same time the aft ship was approaching the dolphins, which were located at the opposite side of the planned lay berth at basin 6. These dolphins were part of the the reason that the aft tug was reduced in her radius action.

Due to the fact that none of the three tugs were able to provide their full assistance with their full engine power and manoeuvring possibilities the vessel collided at the starboard side with the jetty corner of the harbour canal and harbour basin E.
The jetty is a steel / concrete construction.
During the collision with the jetty corner the ship sustained a large hole to her hull  in way of fuel oil tank no. 8 starboard. Size of tank 8 starboard: 710.2 m³.

As a result of the collision, about 6m³ of fuel oil polluted the water.

German master, whose rotation had ended, and a German ship mechanic were to be taken ashore on a tender to start their home leave. The master boarded the tender via the combined accommodation/pilot ladder2 without any problems. However, the ship mechanic, who was following, fell into the water while stepping from the pilot ladder onto the tender's boarding platform. The ship mechanic failed to reach the lifebuoys which were thrown in his direction. He submerged very quickly after a few swimming strokes and did not reappear for quite some time. The crew of the tender were assisted in their attempts to prevent the Seaman, who was showing no signs of life, from drowning by the German master. The vessel had fenders (car tyres) attached and it was initially not possible to pull the lifeless body over her side; therefore, efforts were limited to holding the head of the injured person above water.
It was only possible to recover the seaman at about 06:20 hours after help was received
from the crew of a coastguard patrol boat from which assistance had been requested. The casualty was immediately taken ashore in the tender and transported to a hospital. However, it is very probable that he had already succumbed to his injuries before being recovered from the water.

2.   After sailing, the vessel experienced rough weather and heavy seas, and developed a list to starboard at about 1120. As the list continued, the master ordered to take ballast water simultaneously into No.2 to No.5 port side DB tanks. Upon ballasting, the ship listed further to starboard at about 28° by noon. However, it slowly reduced to almost upright, about 5° to starboard at 1310. The Master then ordered to stop ballasting, directed the vessel back to the port and subsequently dropped anchor in position Lat 12° 44.8’ N Long 074° 44.89’ E, about 5.5 nm off New-Mangalore port at 1430 on 17 July 2009.

He also instructed the C/O to de-ballast the DB tanks simultaneously. However, upon de-ballasting, the vessel listed further to port. The master then ordered the crew to prepare the lifeboat and muster at the boat station except the C/E, 4/E and the duty oiler who were on duty in the E/R.

4.   At about 1610, when the vessel listed 27° to port, the master ordered the duty personnel to vacate from the E/R but leaving the M/E running at dead-slow ahead.

Two pilots boarded at 19.30 and three tugs were in attendance from that time. There was a master pilot exchange of information and a plan for unberthing was agreed.  The forward tug, Serviceman, was secured through the centre lead forward at 20.12.  The aft tug Norman, was secured on the starboard side just forward of the accommodation block at 19.45 hours, and the third tug, Irishman, was standing by to push on whilst lines were being slipped and moved to the port bow to push on until clear of the jetty.At 20.30 all lines had been slipped and were clear of the water.  The fore and aft tugs lifted the vesel clear of the jetty and the pilot moved into the wheelhouse to monitor the radar for clearance of other jetties and buoys.  When the vessel was 0.06 mile clear of No 1 jetty the forward tug Serviceman was ordered to pull full.  Once the pilot had ascertained the vessel was clear of the jetty the main engine was put half astern to move the pivot point aft , making it easier for the tugs to turn the vessel.  Once turned, the engine was put ahead and speed increased.  A speed of 3 knots had been reached when the pilot ordered the forward tug to be slipped.  The pilot then ordered slow ahead on the engine. After a few minutes the pilot was aware that it seemed to be taking a long time to slip the forward tug.  As he thought that, the tug called on VHF and said that the vessel was proceeding too fast and that he was positioned right under the starboard bow - speed was now 5 knots. The pilot reduced the speed, and a conversation about slacking back the wire pursued.  At 20.40 the tug was slipped and clear. there had been no report to the pilot of any incident with the tug.  Later at 21.35 the tug called the pilot and reported an injured crewman and damage to the tug's hull.       Onboard Serviceman the skipper had positioned his vessel under the bow of the tanker and wanted the pilot to confirm that the gear was about to be slipped.  However with the speed increasing on a flood tide, the tug was finding it difficult to maintain directional stability.  The Serviceman began to swing to starboard.  Using full rudder and full power the skipper could not stop the swing to starboard and he collided with the bulbous bow of Aegean Power causing a split in the port side shell plating above waterline, in the vicinity of the engine room.  An inspection revealed no water ingress. The tug was lying alongside the starboard bow of the tanker still waiting for the gear to be slipped, which it was shortly afterwards.  The Serviceman cleared from alongside Aegean Power and returned to Immingham and inspected the damage.  Lessons:  A failure by the crew to release the towing gear promptly and the speed of the Aegean Power caused the tug to lose directional stability.  There was no crewman on the focsle of Aegean power keeping a watchful eye on the tug.","[Primary Annex 1 not designated]","[Primary Annex 1 not designated]","[Primary Annex 1 not designated]","[Primary Annex 1 not designated]","[Primary Annex 1 not designated]","[Primary Annex 1 not designated]","[Primary Annex 1 not designated]","[Primary Annex 1 not designated]","[Primary Annex 1 not designated]","","","","","","","",""

An examination of other remaining fluorescent tube fixtures from UILOQ proved that the electrical connection between the fluorescent tubes and the sockets was poor, cre-ating a high risk of electric arcing and consequently an ignition of fire.

The ship’s command of the Aurora was advised by a pilot on board. The master of the Transanund was in possession of a pilotage exemption certificate. Reduced visibility prevailed at the time of the accident. Therefore, both ships were receiving additional shore-based radar pilotage.
Two oncoming ships passed during the overtaking manoeuvre. One was the Beluga Meditation and the other was the CSCL Europe, which was classified as an exceptionally large ship (AGF). The space available for manoeuvring narrowed because of the oncoming CSCL Europe. The Aurora closed in while overtaking the Transanund and passed at a  distance of about 30 m. This resulted in the Transanund being sucked in and her bow collided with the other ship’s stern. Following the collision, the Aurora ran aground on the southern side of the fairway. The Transanund was able to avoid running aground and continued her voyage to Hamburg shortly afterwards. After ballast operations and the onset of flood, the Aurora was able to free herself under her own steam and also continued her voyage.
There were no fatalities or injuries due to the collision. The BSU was not made aware of any environmental pollution.

As the vessel passed between the breakwaters leaving Port Said a fire broke out in diesel generator No. 4. This unit and unit No. 2 were both in operation providing power for the ship. A number of alarm conditions alerted the automation system of a pending loss of power from No. 4. Diesel generator No. 1 started automatically and took up the electrical load in conjunction with No. 2. Propulsion was maintained, and the Captain made for the first available anchorage.

Crew fire parties were mustered and an attempt was made to enter the engine room, but the team were beaten back by smoke and heat. Passsengers were called to muster stations and looked after by the passenger services teams. A decision to tackle the fire with the CO2 total flooding system was quickly made, and as soon as the vessel was in a position to anchor the engine room was sealed, machinery stopped and CO2 injected.
Boundary cooling was maintained where necessary and temperatures were seen to reduce quite quickly after the CO2 injection. Passengers were held at muster stations until just after midnight when they were allowed more freedom to access open decks in view of the heat in muster stations in June in Egypt with no air conditioning and limited ventilation. At about 00.41 hours an entry was made to the engine room which confirmed that the fire was extinguished and shortly afterwards passengers were allowed to return to their cabins to rest.
Later that morning, 19 June 2009 the vessel was able to re-start units No.1 and No. 2, restore power and make her way back to Port Said, Egypt where passengers were disembarked and the investigation commenced.

Two harbour pilots were assigned to the ship because of her size.

The ship cast off from her berth with the assistance of a forward tug and an aft tug as well as one other tug and sailed initially into the Nordschleuse (north lock) in order to subsequently enter the Weser from there. This manoeuvre took place without incident. 
The sea pilot, who was to take over from the harbour pilots on the Weser, also arrived at the ship in the lock.
Consultation with the pilots of two other ships took place before  and during sailing out of the lock. One of these was the Hyperion, which was still moored at the container pier; the second was the incoming MSC Malin, which was scheduled to moor at the container pier. It was agreed with the Hyperion that she would remain at the pier until the two other ships had passed. MSC Malin was initially held at the western edge of the fairway.

When the ship sailed out of the lock and turned to the Weser an ebb stream prevailed and the wind, meanwhile having decreased considerably, gained strength up to Bft again.

A forward and aft tug assisted in the turning manoeuvre. After further consultation with the pilot of the MSC Malin, a decision to pick up speed and pass the waiting MSC Malin was made on the Höegh London. 
The aft tug was released after the MSC Malin was passed. Subsequently, the ship was unable to maintain the course made good of 331°. Due to the wind, which then acted upon the ship from abeam at 9 to 10 Bft, the ship was set in an easterly direction towards the pier. This ultimately led to a collision with three ships moored at the northern container pier. Their deck cranes received partly heavy damage, the ship and cargo received partly heavy damage. 
It was not possible to stop the Höegh London off the container pier and she therefore collided with two fairway buoys and propeller, and the Hoëgh London was therefore not under command.
There were no personal injuries during the course of the accident. The BSU was not made aware of any pollution. The Höegh London sustained, inter alia, damage to shell plating and the fan cowls to the starboard side due to the collision with other ships.

The major reason for grounding seems to be human error. The Master did not position the vessel towards outbound direction on arrival and did not use tug or pilot service for departure due to good weather conditions. However, the area of shallow water of 6 metres depth at the north area of the pier was not safeguarded by any navigational means, which actually had a negative impact on the conditions of unmooring operations.

The chief engineer discovered that the noise was coming from one of the Power Take Off (PTO) shafts which, in this case, drove the steering gear hydraulic pump.  The chief engineer recommended to the master to stop the ship to prevent the obvious risk of further damage.

The master notified the coastguard of his situation and used his azipod bow thruster to keep the vessel clear of gas rigs and pipelines in the area in case he needed to drop anchor.  In the meantime the management company made arrangements for the tug to tow the vessel into harbour as the master continued to use the bow thruster to drive the vessel at 3 knots towards the port.  At 16.00 hours LT the vessel was under tow and it entered harbour at 19.45 hours LT.

Defect investigation started the following morning and it was found that the PTO shaft roller bearing had broken up through likely fatigue and filings had contaminated the oil charge.  The main gearwheels were found to be undamaged.  The gearbox has been completely dismantled and cleaned.  Although only one of the other bearings appear to have been affected, all are being replaced.

The ship was at 4:30 (am) hours on the leeward side of Groix Island to embark the pilot. The master was on the bridge. He was assisted by the chief officer and by an AB, both had just taken over the watch.

Considering the very poor visibility, Doris was first driven to a waiting anchorage looking forward to an improvement.

As the visibility was improving significantly, the pilot decided to sail the ship in Lorient port through the western fairway.

Doris was heading to her berth following first the ""les soeurs"" transit bearing. After having  begun to turn from 057° to 016.5°, in order  to steer on "" Ile Saint-Michel"" transit bearing the order ""starboard 20"" given to shift the helm had been wrongly  understood and the helm had been put to the left. Doris came rapidly on port and got out of the buoyed fairway and entangled the buoy chain with her screw. The damage suffered had been actually experienced only when the ship got back in the fairway.

When ""La Citadelle"" was abeam the pilot observed that Doris was not answering correctly to the helm. He then called for the tug Scorff waiting at ""Amiral"" buoy. Doris was not any more manageable, the steering was unpredictable. He stopped the headway abreast of Le Pot a shallow in the south of Le Cochon buoy.

Eventually berthed at the tankers wharf thanks to tugs help, Doris Discharged her refined petroleum product load. Two days, the ship was off in tow heading to Rotterdam in order to have her steering gear and her propeller repaired.

At 2230hrs, the OOW who was on the Bridge saw an out bound vessel approaching very close and attempting to pass from port to starboard bow. At this time he flashed signal lamp towards the approaching vessel and after that informed Master of the situation. By the time Master reached Bridge, the other vessel had collided. 
The starboard side gang way area of other vessel had collided with port side fore castle deck of MV Vancouver Victory.
The other ship after collision continued on her way without any concern and response. 
All tank soundings were taken and found no water ingress and all tanks intact. The DPA and the company’s superintendent were informed.
The concerned parties were notified. The vessel was then permitted, by the Class Surveyor, to proceed up to Eastern Anchorage Special Purpose for temporary repairs. After completion of temporary repairs she sailed for port of Jebel Ali on 05 April.

The fire was caused by the spraying of lub oil on the hot surfaces of the aft turbocharger, located between cylinders 5 and 6 of the main engine. 

The fire was fought by the crew members in the engine room using localized fire fighting equipment; however, the fire expanded rapidly, forcing the crew members on-site to evacuate the engine room. In the process, 2 crew members experienced difficulties evacuating the engine room, but eventually managed to leave the engine spaces unharmed. CO2 system was activated at 22:40 hrs. 
During the first moments of the fire-fighting response, the Master of the ship, apparently, suffered a heart attack, which causes his death. At around 23:05 hrs the Chief Officer took over the Master's responsibilities and supervised the fire-fighting operations. 
At 04:00 hrs on April 2, 2009, it was confirmed that the fire was extinguished, and efforts commenced to ventilate the engine room.

The engine staff directly began to clear the oil on the car deck. In order to stop further oil to come into the water they listed the vessel by 1° to starboard. 
At departure from the dock,  oil could be seen  in the propeller water and that indicated that an oil spill of MDO had happened. The Chief Engineer estimated that the spill into the water was about 50 liters. He  sent a report to the port authority.
Oil was later also found in the water in Åland's and Åbolands archipelago and  the fairway to Naantali. It was established later that this oil also came from Finneagle and that the spill was approximately 5 000 liters.

Weather conditions over the preceding two days had been poor and resulted in a disturbed sleep pattern for the crew.
The vessel arrived in port and sailed about five minutes late on the allocated 25 minute turnaround time, with 19 passengers on board.  The bridge organisation consisted of the master on the port bridge wing with the con, the second officer as the officer of the watch, and a quartermaster stood by the helm.  The master manoeuvred the vessel clear of the berth and headed out towards a reef, five cables away, marked by north and south cardinal marks.  Speed was increased to 4 knots.  The second officer was monitoring the master’s actions in case of error and, was responsible for monitoring the vessel’s position. 
The master then instructed that control of engines, bow thrust, and helm, be taken inside the bridge.
Once inside the master stood behind a dirty bridge window, and with the sun directly ahead his vision was obscured and he arranged for the window to be cleaned but became distracted whilst in conversation; speed was increased to 8 knots.  With the window still dirty, but the buoy visual, he then altered course to port with the intention of leaving the reef and the south cardinal mark to starboard.  Inexplicably the turn was stopped early, possibly to counter the effects of leeway, with the buoy still on the port bow.
Fast approaching the reef, the master was alerted to the danger by the second officer who questioned his intentions.
The master immediately recognised the danger and applied full astern pitch and full port thrust.  Unfortunately his actions were too late.  The vessel momentarily grounded on the reef only six minutes after slipping from the berth. 
The vessel suffered substantial hull damage but was able to return to her berth without assistance.

The planned route intentionally avoided busy traffic separation schemes with the master preferring a slightly longer passage, which took the vessel further away from the coast and through a small group of islands.  However, dense concentrations of fishing vessels, some very small, were likely to be encountered throughout the night. 
During the evening, the master calculated that he had some time in hand and decided to stop engines and drift for about 1 hour while in open water in order to save fuel. Passage was then resumed at a speed of 21 knots. The master’s night orders instructed the bridge watchkeeping officers to call him if they required his assistance.
When the chief officer came on watch at 0400, he reviewed the charts to be used and noted the potential danger areas.   Traffic density at that time was fairly light, but gradually increased.  The vessel was being steered by auto pilot and the chief officer was accompanied on the bridge by a lookout. 
By 0600 the numbers of small fishing vessels had increased substantially (Figure) causing the chief officer to make a number of course alterations in order to avoid collision.  The master briefly visited the bridge at around 0630 but, with the chief officer apparently in control of the situation, he soon went below for breakfast. The chief officer was kept busy avoiding small fishing vessels until shortly before 0700 when the numbers encountered started to reduce (Figure). By this time the vessel was approaching the most navigationally constrained part of the passage, with submerged dangers lying 8 cables either side of the planned track. Her speed was still 21 knots and she was to the south of her intended route. The vessel’s position had only been plotted on two occasions between 0600 and 0700, each based on a single radar range and distance.  An ECS was fitted but was only occasionally monitored.
Just when the chief officer thought that he had negotiated most of the traffic in the immediate vicinity, a very small fishing vessel accelerated towards the container ship’s starboard bow.  Constrained by other vessels on the starboard side, the chief officer altered course to port towards a charted reef, which had been highlighted as a danger on the paper chart in use but which the chief officer had forgotten about.  About a minute later, at 0708, the container ship passed over the reef which resulted in the breaching of five of her ballast tanks.

The containers that were in the water punctured one of the fuel tanks, resulting in what was initially reported, a 30-40 tonne loss of fuel, 6 nautical miles off the coast of Moreton Island.  The ship was brought into Brisbane for inspection and repair, at which point it was discovered that a second tank had been punctured below the water line on the opposite side of the ship; resulting in the second tank being completely emptied of its contents.  Varying degrees of oiling were felt along the coastlines of Moreton Island, which was closed to the public, Sunshine Coast to the north of Brisbane, including Birdie Island.  Most of the impacted area consisted mainly of sandy beaches and the significant wave action from the bad weather assisted in dispersing the oil.  It was reported that clean-up efforts were proceeding well with no threat to the barrier reef as it is some 500 km away from the spill site. 
Of the containers lost overboard, none have been recovered; being lost in the 120m of water and believed to have sunk.  Given the depth of the water, they are not expected to come ashore.  The hazard and environmental threat from the ammonium nitrate is low, with environmental impacts expected to be localized and with concentrations falling quickly back to  background levels following it's release.

During the refit the alternator cooling fan was removed for overhaul. The ship's staff electrically isolated the fan by removing the 3 x 160 amp fuses of the 660v fan prior to its removal by the refit contractor. A sign was posted on the cooling fan switchboard cubicle stating that ""Fuses Removed"". 

During the engine re-commissioning the main engine was run in the ""no load"" condition so that it could be set to work in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. In order to put the engine ""on load"" the chief engineer instructed the Third Engineer to close the shaft alternator electrical breaker. However, the breaker could not be closed. The chief engineer was aware that the breaker was interlocked with the alternator cooling fan which needed to be running for the breaker to be closed. Knowing that the fan had been worked on, the chief engineer went to the fan and found that it was stopped. He returned to the Engine Control Room and noticed that the sign on the fan breaker cubicle which stated that the fan fuses had been removed. The chief engineer knew that the alternator supply breaker was open and he assumed that supplies to the services were arranged from the output side of the breaker and so he believed that the complete fan circuit was dead.

The chief engineer fitted the first fuse without mishap. The second fuse was passed to him by the Second Engineer and as the Chief Engineer fitted the second fuse an explosion occurred. The Chief Engineer suffered burns to his right hand, fore arm, face and chest. The chief Engineer was given first aid by the second engineer and remained conscious while being transferred to hospital. 
Had he not been wearing safety glasses and overalls his injuries would have been worse. The chief engineer was hospitalised for 5 days but went on to make a full recovery. 

The investigation found that the fuses protecting the alternator fan motor also controlled the supply to the alternator supply breaker control arrangements. The Chief Engineer was unfamiliar with the circuitry and made an assumption that the circuit was dead when in fact the supply circuits to each of the fuses were live. As the second fuse was replaced the circuit between two of the three phases was completed which caused the alternator fan to ""single phase"" which resulted in the flash. The flash caused irreparable damage to the fuse holder and breaker. The breaker was obsolete and had to be replaced.

The investigation also found that the Chief Engineer did not follow the SMS procedures when replacing the fuses and neither were the Permit to Work instructions properly followed in that there was no recognition that circuits should have been checked even if they were isolated because the input side could be, and in this case was, still live. 

The company has:

- reminded ship's staff of the need for correct SMS compliance
- Continued training sea staff on ""Isolation and Lockout Procedures""
- Reviewed fleet electrical risk assessments
- Improved switchboard signage

Due to the tug boat “AZIZ” was located at the starboard quarter of the towed barge SINA, conducting breast towing, without any assistance from the port’s tugs, the barge and the tug noted moving to port side across the channel obstructing the course of M/V “RAGEEB-1”.

However, when the barge SINA 857 was only 30m distant from the vessel, the towing tugboat AZIZ lost its control on the barge. Therefore, the barge drifted towards the vessel's bow and became in a lateral position and closed the entrance channel.



In a trial to avoid the collision by bow and to minimize the damage in case of its occurrence, the Master of M/V ""RAGEEB-1"" took a decision at 16:20 hrs on the same date to turn engine to half astern and rudder to hard Port Side. However, the barge collided the starboard side of the bow.

The bridge was manned by the pilot, the master at the helm and the second officer. 

MT Vasi was sailing from Klaipéda to Rouen. At 02:47 hours on 12 February 2009, she began to leave the lock as a low-speed, Traffic Group (VG) 4 vessel. In addition to the pilot, the master, second officer and a canal helmsman were situated on the bridge. There was practically on wind and visibility was good.

A collective call made to clarify who should move where and when in the ensuing VHF radio  traffic between to two pilots. The pilot of the Vasi was reportedly aware that he had right-of-way, because his ship was already underway. In spite of that, he reportedly intended to grant  the Birthe Theresa right-of-way as his ship had to pass through the canal at low speed.

Therefore, the Birthe Theresa was to initially remain to the south of the canal axis and increase speed. However, rather than doing that she proceeded to the northern side of the NOK and in doing so cross the bow of the Vasi, which continuously increased her own speed and prepared to overtake. She overtook at 14 km/h while the speed of Birthe Theresa remained at approximately 10 km/h. As the overtaking manoeuvre was almost completed at 02:59 hours, the ships began to sucking port. At 03:00, the two hulls came into contact and remained until 03:06 hours. The ships continued in “a packet”; although they reduced there speed they did not separate from one another. At 03:05 hours, they even passed a upcoming ship. At 03:07, the bow of the Birthe Theresa turned away to starboard and she sailed into the northern embankment. The Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) was then able to continue her voyage to Brunsbûttel. The Birthe Theresa freed herself from the embankment under her own steam and then returned to Kiel.

The skipper and a deckhand had prepared the ship accordingly. The trip began at about 07:00 hours in the Westhafen in Wismar. The Christa followed the fairway and was to then pass through the Flaggtief to reach the open sea. The Timmendorf/Poel approach buoy was also situated on this route.

The skipper was alone on the bridge and used a radar device. 
Earlier two people had also set off for a fishing trip on the ODIN, a pleasure craft. When the ODIN was situated on the vicinity of the Timmendorf/Poel port approach buoy, the crew detected water inside the boat. In order to clarify the cause, the boat was stopped and the engine switched off. Shortly after that, the crew began to make a temporary repair. During this period, only the passenger noticed a distant ship.
The crew of the Odin only became aware of this ship again when it was on a collision course at a distance of between approximately 100 m and 200 m. They attempted to draw attention to themselves by shouting, waving and sounding a signal horn.
However, they were unsuccessful and the Christa collided with the pleasure craft. The crew of Odin had removed themselves from the danger area prior to this happening by jumping into the water.

On board the Christa, the Odin remained unnoticed until she was only approximately 30 m away and therefore it was no longer possible to avoid the collision. Prior to that, the pleasure craft was reportedly neither detected visually nor by radar.

The Odin was heavily damaged during the collision. The stern sank immediately afterwards. The Christa was only slightly damaged.
The two crew members of the Odin were taken on board the Christa and cared for. Sometime after, a search and rescue boat took the two individuals ashore, where they were initially treated by an emergency doctor and later taken to a hospital.

The engineers were unable to immediately re-start the engine and so the vessel went to anchor.  The Coastguard was advised and the information passed to SOSREP.  The vessel was in the east bound shipping lane and as the light failed the ship managers arranged, with SOSREP’s approval, for the MCA's ETV to take the vessel under tow into a nearby port.  Before the ship reached port the engineers identified the problem, re-started the engine and the tug was released and the vessel continued her passage.

The initial problem was a blocked filter on the fuel transfer system which prevented the day tank from being replenished and so the engine suffered fuel starvation which resulted in it stopping.  Once this was resolved there was then a problem re-starting the engine as the governor failed to hold the fuel rack in the full fuel position during the start procedure.  The problem was found to be a seized servo piston in the governor.  This was cleaned and proven to be free and the engine successfully started.

The ship managers have revised the cleaning frequency for the fuel oil transfer system and that of the governor piston.  They have also issued a Safety Alert to their fleet advising of the circumstances of the accident and of the action to be taken.

As the owner’s arrangement, after completing cargo operation at the port of Zhangjiagang, China, she sailed to and anchored at XIAZHIMEN anchorage on 25th December 2008.  As the owner’s arrangement, the ship’s crew was repatriated except 4 crew members who remained on duty on board.  These crew members were: Mr.Wu Dongdong, Mr Wang Aguo,Mr Song Hailun, and Mr.Wang Feixiang.

Struck by M/V “GRAND VENTURE”
On 14th January 2009, the M/V “LAI LONG” was safely anchored at the XIAZHIMEN anchorage at a GPS position of Lat.29.44.985N, Long .122.21.025E, with port side anchor and 7 shackles on deck. The weather was fine with good visibility, the wind force was about 4 in Beaufort scale in NE direction. The sea was mostly calm.

As arranged, Mr Wu Dongdong, the duty third officer was on duty on the bridge as well as patrolling on deck between 0600-1200 hours.
At about 10.00 hours, Mr Wu Dongdong left the bridge and patrolled on the main deck  starboard side. 
At about 10.20 hours LT on the same day, Mr Wang Aguo was on duty on the main deck starboard side, and both crew members observed an underway vessel(named M/V “GRAND VENTURE”) approaching from the port bow very close to their own vessel. Mr Wu Dongdong immediately called M/V “GRAND VENTURE” via VHF on channel 16. Howerver, there was no reply from the approaching vessel and no avoiding action was taken by the vessel to a close quarter situation.

At about 10.25 hours, they witnessed the forward of the oncoming vessel pass the bow of their own vessel; a very loud noise was heard and the vessel vibrated strongly. They later discovered that their vessel had been struck by the starboard quarter of M/V “GRAND VENTURE”.

The ship’s crew hurried to the forecastle deck and found that LAI LONG's forecastle deck,  the adjacent bulwark and the bosun store side plate had been damaged during the incident. They also found that the aft accommodation starboard side of M/V “GRAND VENTURE” was also slightly damaged during the collision.
During the incident, no information could be obtained from M/V”GRAND VENTURE” via VHF by the duty officer. After the collision, the GRAND VENTURE continued her trip without stopping.
Without any delay, Mr Wu Dongdong reported the incident to the shipowner as well as to Ningbo MSA Office via VHF8. Later on he noted that M/V “GRAND VENTURE” anchored at the same anchorage.

Ningbo MSA Office’s investigation:
On the same day at about 15.00 hours 2 officers of Ningbo MSA attended onboard for investigation and they disembarked the vessel at about 17.45 horrs. It was reported that some other MSA officers also attended onboard M/V “GRAND VENTURE” for investigation on the same day.

Together with Mr. Sha Yongbin, the owner’s superintendent, and Mr.Zhao, the surveyor from the GRAND VENTURE, the damages were carefully inspected and the are listed hereunder:-
  
   From Outside: 1.The starboard side bulwark of forecastle was distorted/cracked.
                           2. A big hole was found in way of starboard side shell plate.
                           3. Upper 8.5 m the draft line of starboard side shell plate in way of FPT was found dent/scratched.
   Fore Peak Tank: The shell plate in way of BH starboard side and the adjacent side frames were dent/distorted.
   Bosun Store: The shell plating of the bosun store, between Fr6(from aft of bosun store) of starboard side and Fr 14 of port side (fore end is Fr17) was distorted/cracked, and the adjacent attachment, such as the side frames, the fire pipes, and etc were damaged too.
  Forecastle Deck: The starboard side bulwark and the adjacent attachment, such as the bracket. Faceplate, the deck and the fairlead pedestal were damaged.

At 13:50 hours, she began her eastward canal passage as a Traffic Group (V5) 4 ship under pilot advice.
The collective call at 13:45 hours informed the ship's command about upcoming ship while they were passing through the lock. The ship's command was aware that they would pass the upcoming Birka Express in the Kudensee siding area. Shortly before the encounter in the Kudensee siding area,  the pilot reportedly observe the Birka Express began to turn to port and then  pass through the canal axis with her forecastle.
Following that, he reportedly gave the command full astern. An evasion manoeuvre was not possible without putting the ORKA at risk, which was sailing just ahead on the starboard. However, a collision was no longer avoidable.

The Birka Express was sailing from Helsinski to Hull. She passed westward through the NOK as a Traffic Group 5 ship under pilot advice on 12 January 2009. Due to the collective call at 13:45 hours, the ship's command knew that a Traffic Group 4 container ship was approaching them and would be passed in the Kudensee siding area.

To reduce the ship's speed in good time before reaching the stop signal without compromising the steerability, the pitch of the propeller was  reportedly set to zero and then to 50% astern. The hydrodynamic effect of this pronounced astern manoeuvre and the increasing wind pressure moved the ship to port. The forecastle with the superstructure if the partially loaded ship then turned further to port and the stern approached the dolphins on the northern side. In spite of all subsequent manoeuvres, it was not possible to prevent a collision.

The impact was reportedly very severe. However, the ship parted from one another immediately. Damage was assessed and the Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) informed immediately. Both ships were still fully manoeuvrable. While the Hanse Vision sailed onwards for Kiel, the Birka Express ended her canal passage in Brunsbüttel and moored and the dolphins in the inland port there.

A ce moment, il aperçoit, sur son bâbord, à 5 milles environ, un navire de charge qui fait route dans la voie montante du rail de circulation entre le Dispositif de Séparation du Trafic (DST) de Ouessant et des Casquets.
