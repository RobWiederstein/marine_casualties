The intention was to load test progressively up to 31 tonnes using  water bags suspended from a certified wire and shackles supplied by the load test contractor.   However it was found that the load cell shackle pin would not fit through the hard eye of the supplied rope.    It was agreed by all parties to use a bowline knotted plasma rope of 70 t breaking strain to hang the water bag from the load cell shackle.   The water bag was lifted clear of the quayside and filling was commenced using a fresh water supply from the quay.  At a load between 10-12 tonnes the sheaves on test were inspected for any structural change.  None was found so filling of the water bag continued.  At a load of about 17 tonnes the rope failed and the water bag fell to the edge of the quay.  There was no damage and no injuries.

The introduction of the knotted rope into a tested lifting system caused the collapse.  Reference books state that the strength of a rope is reduced by at least 50% when knotted.  In this case the rope failed at about 25% of its breaking strain. 

The DPA has promulgated the lessons learnt and warned of the reduction in breaking starin when a knot is fitted to a system.

There were 4 main engines, No 1 engine was out of service for maintenance.  As the ferry left its French port No 3 main engine was shut down in accordance with normal procedures.  The crossing was then made on Nos 2 and 4 main engines.

The engineers attempted to start No 3 main engine when the ferry was about 3 miles from the UK port, but this was unsuccessful.  The master decided to abandon port entry when about 1.5 miles from the entrance. At one mile from the entrance No 4 main engine stopped and the master turned the ferry away from the port.  A short time later No 1 main engine, the final running engine stopped and a blackout occurred.  The emergency generator immediately came on line.  

The master then ordered a tug to assist and shortly afterwards let go of the port anchor, 5 shackles on deck.  An hour later the situation had not been resolved but 2 tugs were by now standing by.  The engineers managed to start one generator but at severely reduced power.  Breakers were operated to allow the generator to supply only the port winch motor.  The anchor was raised and the two tugs towed the ferry into port about one hour later.

The MCA surveyor and the company technical superintendent attended the vessel.  It was found that the low pressure air activated heavy fuel oil filters were defective.  The air from the actuator was pressurising the fuel bowl and forcing air into the fuel system.  It was believed that a fuel problem had occurred and the engineers cross connected the fuel systems.  This caused the air to be transferred into the other fuel system causing the cascade failure of the engines.

The engineers eventually discovered the faulty changeover cock and replaced the seals.

The engines were subsequently trialled with the technical superintendent and MCA surveyors present.  Trial included a one hour full power trial which was trouble free.

At about 17.50 hours LT on 27 January, the ship’s engineers attempted to rectify an elevator fault that had been reported earlier in the day. After making some adjustments to the second deck elevator landing door switches, the electrical technician stepped onto the ladder in the elevator shaft. He then asked the second engineer to let the doors close behind him. 

Soon after the doors closed, the elevator car travelled upwards and after a few seconds it stopped. 

The second engineer could not open the second deck elevator landing doors. He called the third engineer, on his hand held radio, and told him to come to the second deck. The two men tried, unsuccessfully, to open the elevator doors.

The two men then went upstairs and opened the upper deck elevator landing doors. They looked down and saw the electrical technician. He had been trapped by the elevator car and he appeared to be unconscious. Shortly afterwards, the second engineer activated the general alarm.

The master reported the accident to the refinery operator while the crew tried to free the electrical technician. 
Assistance arrived from ashore and, at about 19.20 hours LT, the refinery doctor examined the electrical technician and pronounced him dead.

Upon investigation it was found that the limit switch was fully operational.

Since the pilot was to come on board at the Elbe Buoy, the bosun received an order around 08:00 hours, to rig the pilot ladder on the starboard side.
The freeboard of the ballasted carrier LENA was approximately 11 metres so it was decided to rig the so-called ""combined accommodation/pilot ladder"". This comprises a classic rope ladder and a permanently installed gangway. One the rope ladder was rigged, the gangway was lowered to an angle of 40° so that its landing rests next to the rope ladder. 
The stanchions were set up and the handhold stanchions secured. Then the bosun wanted to connect the end of the gangway with the rope ladder using a rope end.
No one saw him falling overboard, but his shout was heard and the crew immediately instigated the necessary rescue measures.

The distress call to the Maritime Rescue Co-ordinating Centre (MRCC) in Bremen activated different rescue units including a helicopter that sighted the accident victim at 09:18 hours and recovered him at 09:21 hours. At 10:05 hours, he was delivered to the hospital in Oldenburg. Due to being in the cold water for too long, he died in hospital on 23 January 2007

The pilot disembarked on 12 January 2007 at 00:45 hours. The ship’s speed was adapted to the sea conditions. After passing buoy 4a, German Bight Traffic was informed that the JRS Canis was on her way to the Kiel Canal. At this point, the ship was pitching and rolling severely.
A true course of 330° was applied and the ship was sailing at about 7 kn. After passing an oncoming ship, the course was altered to 060° and the speed was changed to about 15.5 kn. 
This wind was approaching from 285° at force 9 Bft. 
At 02:40 hours the ship keeled briefly to each side, several times, by up to 20°.  The bridges crew were able to see that the container stack on the port side leaned inwards while the container stack on the starboard side shifted outwards. At the same time 10 containers were lost overboard.
The German Bight Vessel Traffic Service was immediately informed of the incident. Then an inspection was made on deck to determine the damage. The decision was made to continue the voyage to the Kiel Canal at reduced speed.

On exiting the Dutch River Berth the vessel suffered a main engine failure and the captain immediately ordered the anchor to be let go.  

The next 2 hours was spent on trying to restart the engine but this was unsuccessful.  It was initially suspected that the engine had suffered a fuel supply problem.  The electrical generators continued to function normally.  The harbour authorities decided that the vessel should move from the anchorage and the management company arranged for the vessel to be towed the short distance to the berth.

The vessel was attended by an engineer and MCA and Class surveyors the following morning.  The engine operates on a dry sump system.   It was found that the main engine oil charge was still in the engine sump and had not been transferred to the daily lube oil tank.  The engine stopped because the low lube oil pressure trip operated, thus protecting the engine.  Further investigation found that the lube oil scavenge pump was defective.  The pump was removed and overhauled by a local engineering company and refitted the following day.  The engine was successfully test run and the vessel sailed a short time later.

The weather was poor with winds gusting to Force 9 and worsening when the vessel suffered a main engine failure at approximately 08.12 hours LT.

The coastguard was alerted and checked the availability of helicopter and lifeboat resources.  In the meantime the engineers onboard checked the fuel system which they believed may have been agitated by the poor weather.  The fuel system was found to be functioning correctly and the generators continued to function.

The engineers were able to start the engine but it would not continue to run.  The Aquamaster retractable thruster was used to affect some steerage control.  As this was happening a towing vessel in the vicinity made her way to standby the vessel and the CG continued to carry out routing hourly safety checks with the vessel.  The vessel was eventually taken under tow and arrived safely alongside some 8 hours later.

Further investigation showed that the drive shaft to the Roots mechanical turbo charger had sheared due to metal fatigue at the step down near to the second supporting bearing.  Spares were being sourced from Norway.

The AB walked to a tank cleaning hatch where he started to loosen the finger nut on the hatch. As soon as he started to loosen the finger nut, gas was released from the hatch. The AB immediately left the spot,  but fell down unconscious beside a ladder. An apprentice who was close by tried to move the AB away from the place, but as he himself felt dazed he had to get away. He was able to inform the second officer of what had happened before he too fell down more or less unconscious on the poop deck. The second officer ran down to the deck and by holding his breath he was able to reach the hatch and close it. The AB and the apprentice were taken to hospital.
The investigation shows that there were no MSDS available onboard the vessel. On the vessel it was more or less customary to take samples by opening the tank cleaning hatch. Although the vessel was fully equipped with a closed sampling vapour lock system, the tank cleaning hatches was seen as a more convenient method on this occasion as the cargo was regarded as relatively harmless. The AB acted by force of habit when he opened the tank cleaning hatch. The tank in question was filled to about 75 per cent which contributed to the high concentration of gas. The Investigation also pointed out the importance of using all available equipment and systems in the way they are meant to, and that MSDS always should be available onboard before the loading commences.","TANKER","Serious injuries","2947","Bureau Veritas (BV)","4320","Oil mixed water","11","","","","","","1","","","",""

Subsequent investigation indicated that the fire started in the vicinity of the sauna. The cause of the fire was considered to be either a fault with the sauna heater, a fault in the lighting in the sauna, an electrical short-circuit, or by crew leaving items on top of the sauna heater.

The ship did not carry any passengers. When entering Rønne Port in the evening there was a strong wind from southwest and west and a high sea.
The bridge watch team felt as if the ship was almost “surfing” on following seas, when VILLUM CLAUSEN was approximately three times a ship’s length from the entrance to the harbour. According to the statements, this caused the ship to alter its course unintentionally and it was forced to port side. Thus, the ship was heading direct towards the pier-head north of the outer entrance to the harbour. 
The master and the chief officer did not succeed in getting the ship back on its course, and it became clear to the master that a collision with the pier was inevitable. Therefore, he concentrated on reducing speed as much as possible.
VILLUM CLAUSEN collided with the pier-head at approximately 1938 hours.
Shortly after the accident, the bridge crew managed to get the ship safely alongside in the harbour by the ship’s own power.
The ship was moored at approximately 19.48 hours LT.
Three crewmembers were slightly injured in the collision. 

According to a prognosis by DMI (Danish Meteorological Institute), the significant wave height was within the limits according to the permit to operate issued by the Danish Maritime Authority

The Division for Investigation of Maritime Accidents is of the opinion that the main cause for the ship’s loss of steering control was that the ship was surfing on a following wave. The ship’s speed in the sea was of significant importance to why the bridge watch team was not able to get the ship back on course.

The ship’s stern – and thereby also the water jets – may have been lifted out of the water, thus the manoeuvrability of the ship may have been reduced momentarily

The ship’s speed had a significant influence on the sequence of events – both with regards to the possibility of altering the dangerous course towards the pier and the possibility of stopping the ship after the control of the steering had been lost.

The vessel had suffered a tube leak on the combination boiler which was due to boiler tube fatigue.  Soon afterwards, at 05.15 hours LT while off the Dutch coast, the vessel suffered an electrical blackout.  The captain immediately ordered that both anchors be let go.  The engineers traced the fault to an electrical circuit board on the generator’s excitation circuit.  This caused the generator to shed its load onto the only other, parallel running, generator.  That in turn tripped the supply breaker on overload protection, causing the blackout.

The fault was rectified within 3 hours and the generators proven to be running correctly.

The port anchor was successfully hauled in but as the starboard anchor was being recovered the weather deteriorated again and the anchor paid out to within 2 shackles of the “bitter end”.  Unable to haul the cable in the captain contacted the DPA who approved jettisoning the anchor and cable.

The usual safety meeting was carried out between the crew and terminal loading representative and 2 firemen allocated to the ship during the period of discharge; however, the terminal staff were not informed of the defective gauge.

It was decided to carry out work on the gauge during cargo discharging operations.  The chief officer and 2 of the ship's gas engineers were working on the top of the tank which had the defective gauge.  The gauge top had been opened and methanol was being used to free the components.  The methanol was contained in a plastic bucket.  It is notable that the normal Permit to Work procedures had not been carried out and no electrical isolations had been made.  At about 15.55 hours LT the bucket of methanol fell from the domed tank top and hit the deck, at which point it burst into flames about 2.5m high.  The chief officer and gas engineer were on the tank top as the fire started.  The duty officer saw the flame and immediately pushed the emergency cargo discharge shut down button.  At the same time he took a dry powder extinguisher and put the fire out.  The fire lasted less than one minute.  The master, hearing the emergency shut down ran to the deck.  Although the fire was short lived the fire alarm was not used and the terminal staff nor port authorities were not informed.

Soon after the fire was put out the area was cleaned and painted.  At 16.12 hours LT the terminal staff instructed the chief officer to stop discharging cargo.  Fire officers went onboard as well as the port chemist.  Discharging recommenced at 18.36 hours LT.  At about 19.05 hours LT the vessel was checked again by the port authorities.  At 19.48 hours LT the master received a request by UHF to stop pumping and proceed to an anchorage.  At the same time the master advised and ordered Ch Eng to report the incident to the Company.  He did so by telephone.

It was unclear at the time whether the vessel had struck an object causing damage or whether it was as a result of bad weather and high seas, or due to a manufacturing defect. The crew removed ballast from the after end of the vessel to reduce the water pressure on the rudder stock.

The CG maintained a 2 hour watch as the casualty made her way towards Lerwick using the bow thruster to assist in steering. As the vessel approached Lerwick, steerage became more difficult with the increasingly bad weather and a tow was connected as a safety precaution.
On arrival at Lerwick the operators arranged for divers inspection and found that the port rudder had become detached below the keyway on the tiller arm. The recovered upper section was removed and the section forwarded for metallurgical analysis. The outcome of this investigation is not known but the failure is suspected to be due to metal fatigue exacerbated by severe weather.

At 13.29 hours LT, prior to the time of impact, the pilot ordered to let go the starboard anchor in an effort to stop the bow from further swinging to the port.

The vessel managed to clear the loading berth and the master then ordered the starboard anchor to be let go. The ship drifted across the harbour and made contact with another Quay in the way of the starboard quarter.  The vessel then fell bodily onto No4 Ro-Ro berth and the ship's hull plating was pierced due to the contact.
The initial investigation identified that No2 DG main breaker had come out, which in turn caused a progressive shut down of power generators and, ultimately, the total loss of electrical power and main engines. 
This was the result of the failure of the shaft generators to load share with the DG's.  After testing various modes of shaft generators against DG's, the company  produced a written procedure ( ECR and bridge)  for the operation of a single shaft generator with the bridge giving permission to go on shaft when safe to do so.  The incident was the accidental stopping of a main engine powering a shaft generator.  The power management system worked as designed.  The stopping of the ME was from a remote panel  which has a check system built in which requires three definite requests.  This was a human factors related incident and showed that care needs to be exercised when stopping engines at sea, as positive reporting could have prevented the accident.

The cruising speed was said to have been reduced since the weather continued to deteriorate. A strong gale from the west developed with gusts of wing measuring 11 Bft and a westerly swell with waves 7 to 8 m height. 

After various alarms from the bunker room between hold 2 and hold 3 had sounded during the night, the ship command decided to send the Chief and Second engineers to the bunker room to remedy the source of the alarms.

This took place at the start of the day shortly after 08:00 hours. Both engineers refrained from using a safety line so as not to be obstructed by it. Instead they gripped the railing whenever a wave washed over them. One of the waves hurtled the second engineer overboard around 08:25 hours. His immersion suit did not have a flotation device but kept him warm and a fender which also had been torn loose kept him afloat until he was saved.  The ship command promptly informed German Bight Traffic and requested assistance. 

On account of the bad weather conditions, the ship command reportedly decided that a return manoeuvre such as the “Williamson Turn” would be too dangerous for the ship, its crew and cargo. The Beluga Stimulation continued onwards without changing its course or speed.

After the second engineer had fallen into the water, he was rescue alive by the rescue vessel Bernhard Gruben and brought to a hospital in Wilhelmshaven. The hypothermia and external injuries were not life-threatening with the result that he was able to resume his work on the ship just a few days later

In spite of no oil pollution occurring, signsof oil on the sea surface were observed, probably indicating that there was a minor leak of oil diesel. With the evaporation and immediate dispersion it was not possible to confirm if the oil was a result of the collision. 
After the removal of the shipwrecked hull the existence of oil in the tanks was verified and there were no damages that would indicate leaking. The most probable hypothesis is that the oil vestiges that arose in water were derived from residues in the vessel basement.
The vessel COSTA AZUL was submerged to a depth of 30 meters.  After several attempts, its wrecked hull was raised from the water early on  the day of 26th  October 2006.

The leak was sealed 29 hours later, after an estimated 66 tonnes of propane had been lost to atmosphere.
The fully pressurised gas carrier ENNERDALE arrived at FMT's No.2 berth at 2300 on 15 October 2006, to load liquefied propane.  Preloading checks were conducted and loading commenced shortly after.  At 1830 on 17 October the loading operation was halted, approximately 2 hours before cargo loading was due to be completed, to allow a 'freeze' test to be conducted.  A cargo surveyor came aboard and attached his cargo sampling equipment to the sampling point of tank No.1.  The cargo was then circulated for 2-3 minutes.  The process was repeated for tank No.2.  With the test results satisfactory, cargo loading continued and completed at 2100.
The cargo surveyor returned to the ship and went straight to the sampling point of tank No.1, where the chief officer was already preparing.  The cargo surveyor used a thread adapter to connect the sampling device to the ship's sampling connection.  The chief officer then circulated the cargo, using the deep well pump, to ensure a good representative sample was obtained.  The cargo surveyor flushed the sampling device through three times before filling it.  He repeated the process, taking four samples in total, before moving aft to the sampling point of tank No.2.  While the chief officer secured tank No.1, the cargo surveyor prepared to fit his equipment to the sampling point of tank No.2.  As he turned the sampling connection towards himself, the sampling valve assembly came off in his hand.
The chief officer saw and heard a leak and activated the emergency shut down (ESD) valves.  Attempts were made to refit the sampling valve but the 11 bar pressure of the cargo, and the formation of ice on the connection, made it impossible.  It soon became apperent that the ESD valve adjacent to the tank on the same line as the sampling connection was not completely shut.
The emergency services were alerted soon after the accident and the ship was doused in water sprays to disperse the gas cloud.  At 2200, the port of Southampton was closed to all traffic.  All ships at FMT were evacuated at 0000.  At 0530 on 18 October, with the situation stabilised, traffic restrictions were reduced to a 400m exclusion zone around ENNERDALE, which allowed the port to reopen to traffic.
After several options to stop the leak had been considered, it was decided to hot tap the cargo pipework and inject a sealing compound to stop the leak of gas.  A company regularly used at Fawley refinery, successfully drilled into the pipework at 1408 on 18 October.  The sealing compound was then slowly injected into the pipework, enabling the leak to be sealed and capped at 0240 the next morning.
ENNERDALE then sailed and anchored in the Solent, awaiting clearance to sail which was contingent upon class approval of the repair and the discharge port agreeing to accept the vessel.  This completed, she sailed at 1814 the same day.","LIQUEFIED GAS TANKER","Pollution","4227","Nippon Kaiji Kyokai (NKK)","4285","","19","","1","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","2008-09-30","2009-04-28"

At 0030 an engine room alarm sounded indicating that pressure in the steam system was low.  The crew investigated the cause of the alarm and discovered that steam was escaping from the auxiliary boiler air intake.  They shut down the burner and opened the furnace door.  Steam escaped, and when it had cleared they could see that the furnace tube was severely distorted and cracked.
There was some delay before the chief engineer was informed about the breakdown, and further delay before the problem was reported to the master on the bridge.  Although the vessel could have anchored safely to investigate the situation, it was agreed that the main engine could continue to run at low power, and the vessel proceeded to sea.
An Exhaust Gas Economiser (EGE) was fitted in the funnel uptakes to generate steam from the waste heat contained in the main engine exhaust gases, using water circulated from the auxiliary boiler.  At about 0200, a rapid rise in the temperature of the EGE was noticed and the chief engineer realised that there was a fire inside the EGE casing.  The bridge was alerted at 0230 and the vessel's emergency alarm was activated.  Radiant heat from the EGE ignited light fittings, cables and paint on bulkheads in the funnel uptakes, and the crew attempted to fight the fire with a water hose and a fire extinguisher.  They were beaten back by the heat and smoke and the engine room was evacuated.
The crew were mustered and firefighters re-entered the funnel uptakes and began to cool the EGE casing using water hoses; they were withdrawn when their team leader grew concerned that the structure might collapse.  The main engine room CO2 gas smothering system was activated, but failed to discharge correctly and, in any case, would have had little effect on the fire.   The fire was contained using water hoses to cool its boundaries and was finally extinguished, following advice received from the company head office, by drenching the EGE with water from the top of the funnel and through doors in the EGE casing.","CONTAINER SHIP","Ship rendered unfit to proceed","51931","Lloyd's Register (LR)","60200","","23","","1","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","2008-09-23","2009-04-28"

He was wearing overalls at the time but the sleeves were rolled up. Consequently, the overalls did not protect his arms.
The fire occurred when the heat created by the compression of the oxygen within the system ignited a replacement hose that had been fitted into the system. The hose had a lining made from a material with a low ignition temperature that had been made in an oily environment. It was not fit for its intended purpose and did not comply with any standards for high pressure oxygen hoses.
The hose had been fabricated by a hose supplier who had not been trained about the hazards or standards associated with high pressure oxygen systems and had ambiguous information regarding the suitability of those materials for the purpose.

Shortly after the start of dredging, the untrained crewman started to clear the cockles from the chute into the hold as he had the previous day. As he was scrapping the cockles down the chute with his right hand, he placed his left hand on the riddle frame assuming there was enough space to grip between the supporting frame and the rotating drum.

Three men were burnt/scalded by an unexpected release of very hot water. One man later died of his injuries.
During the night, No 4 economizer circulating failed due to a leaking mechanical seal, and the discharge pressure dropped off. To avoid damage to the boiler, No 4 diesel was stopped and a Gas Turbine was started. 
The isolation valves to and from the pump were closed and locked and work on draining down the economizer began. The pump casing vents were also opened to let the pump drain down. After the vessel's arrival in port, the day work maintenance team began to remove the pump for repair. It was noted that the pressure in the pump was zero and the drains had stopped running.  At this time the vent pipe was removed from the volute casing and the casing was open to atmosphere.
When the pump impeller casing was moved back from the volute casing (which was left in place bolted to the pipework), a quantity of very hot water / steam issued from the volute casing splashing up over the mechanic, who was lifting the impeller casing out, inflicting scald burns over the front of his body, arms and legs. 
Water also splashed over the Senior Maintenance engineer and the other mechanic, who were standing to each side, inflicting small scald burns to their faces.
Although this was originally reported as a hazardous incident, the man has since died from his injuries, and the incident has therefore been upgraded.
Standard and reasonable precautions were followed prior to carrying out this maintenance, (which has been done many times in the past). The system had been vented and proved zero pressure. Due to the design of the pipe work system, the suction lines to the pumps which are situated between the boilers on the tank top level, comes from the top half of the vertical boiler just below the working water level. 
This height from the pump suction to the top of the pipe where it comes out of the boiler shell is 5 meters, X DN150mm bore. This constitutes a static head of water of 0.5 bar with no boiler pressure acting on it.  The volume of water in the pipe would be 88 ltrs when full.
When the water is draining from the pump casing, the weight of water and the level going down the pipe would pull a vacuum in the top section of the pipe, till the vacuum generated was able to support the remaining volume of water left in the pipe, which would then be much less than 88 ltrs. At this point the water would be suspended in the pipe with the bottom end open to atmosphere till the vacuum broke and the water gushed out. This time is indeterminable, but in this case it occurred almost instantly. 
A report from owners stated that that additional drain/vent valves were fitted to the economiser circ pump system at various points. These will allow safe drainage AND venting, ensuring that the long vertical suction legs cannot trap water under a standing vacuum effect.
Additional valves were fitted on suction side of all 4 econ circ pumps that will ensure a minimum of 2 valve separation when overhauling these pumps.

At about 02.45 hours LT on 12 September, the almost fully laden ship broke away from the wharf under the influence of a strong ebb tide.
Despite the use of several tugs and the ship’s engine, it was not possible to manoeuvre the ship back alongside the wharf. The harbour master decided to hold the ship in the deepest part of the port’s entrance channel until the next high tide.
By about 06.15 hours LT on 12 September, the ship was firmly aground in the channel and, at about 09.50, it was successfully refloated.
The ATSB investigation found that the effective holding capacity of the ship’s mooring winch brakes was reduced by the number of layers of mooring line on the winch drums and the poor condition of their brakes. The investigation also found that it was highly likely that the brakes had not been sufficiently tightened and that the mooring winches were not effectively monitored in the time leading up to the incident.
The investigation also found that neither the port authority nor the ship’s master had identified the possibility of the ship breaking away from its berth and appropriately assessed the risks associated with this potential hazard. 
The report issued two recommendations and five safety advisory notices to address the identified safety issues.

At 05.45 hours LT, during a turn with a pilot onboard the ship, she experienced steering problems - steering was in hand control - and the rudder remained at 5 degrees to starboard. No alarms were heard but the alarm status was recorded on the data logger system.  The AB on the helm immediately informed the pilot and officers but the pilot did not hear him as he was talking on the vhf radio at the time.  The officer of the watch checked the steering motor indications, both motors indications showed them to be ""on"".  The 3/O immediately contacted the engine room and the duty engineer went to the steering gear compartment.  He also informed the captain who was in his cabin at the time. The engineer moved the rudder a few degrees using the local emergency control in the steering gear compartment and steering was re-instated.  In the meantime the 3/O had started the bow thruster to assist in steering.  Unfortunately the pilot operated the thruster control, but the motor tripped on overload because the motor was not at the correct operating speed.  However, at 08.23 hours LT the ship touched bottom.  A standby tug put a line aboard and the vessel was immediately hauled off.  The port authorities, class and ship's staff thoroughly checked the steering system but no defects were discovered. There was no damage to the hull and the ship was able to resume its passage after hull checks.  

A manufacturer’s representative found a faulty PCB on the steering Follow Up (FU) unit which was the cause of the initial failure.  The 3/0 was unfamiliar with the method of changing from FU to Non FU in the event of an emergency, but had he done so  the grounding would not have occurred.

The company has since conducted further training with the bridge team to ensure that they fully understand the alternative methods of steering. ","VEHICLES CARRIER","Ship remains fit to proceed","46800","DNV AS (DNV)","12600","Cars","27","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","",""

At 18.50 hours LT GPS lat: 16 43.3 N lon: 082 23.5 E, the vessel grounded in shallow waters. In spite of efforts to refloat, the vessel remained grounded in sandy water 3.0 nm east of coast. Bad weather in the next few days shifted the vessel closer to the coast. Further efforts to refloat the vessel on 1st July 2006 were also unsuccessful and the starboard anchor chain was broken by swell blows  10 m far of anchor. The salvage tug boat MAHO OYA  arrived on 9 th August 2006 at 19.00 hours LT and on 10th August refloating efforts were again made using the engine and tug boat. The vessel was refloated at 08.50 hours LT on 11th August and she proceeded to Kakinada port where she dropped anchor at  12.25 hours.

The master took over the watch when the ship reached the drill rig at 1950 and the second mate remained on the bridge to operate the bulk-board for the cargo transfer.  After completion of cargo operations, the master handed the watch back to the second mate, and then went to bed.
At 0100 on 29 August, the ship departed the drill rig.  The second mate checked the global positioning system (GPS) unit, and then set the autopilot to follow a course of 129° (T).  The weather was good with light winds, slight seas and visibility of about eight miles.
At 0200 and 0400, the second mate recorded the ship's GPS position in the deck log book, but did not plot either position on the navigational chart.  At about 0400, the bridge lookouts changed watches but the second mate decided to leave the chief mate in bed until the ship reached the Dampier Sea Buoy.
At 0445, MASSIVE TIDE was making good a speed of 9.8 knots when it grounded on the shoals approaching the western shore of Rosemary Island.
The crew were called out and checks of the ship, its machinery and the surrounding area revealed that no damage or pollution had occurred.  Immediate attempts to refloat the ship were unsuccessful and plans were put in place to try again on the next high tide.

The last record of the yacht was at 2230 on 20 August when she went out of range of the Southampton/Portsmouth VTS radar system in Sandown Bay.  At this time it is believed that the yacht was sailing close hauled in a south-south-westerly direction.
Voyage data recorder (VDR) records from ships that had been in the area during the night of 20/21 August were recovered and analysed by MAIB inspectors in order to use the radar information to trace the movements of the yacht.

The ship was fully laden with a cargo of fertiliser, loaded at Safi, in Morocco. 

Before boarding Midland 2, the designated pilot had decided that tug assistance would not be required for berthing, because the north-westerly winds were light and the ship should be quite manoeuvrable as she had two propellers and a bow thruster. After the pilot had boarded the ship, in a position south-east of Penlee Point, he handed the master a two-page Plymouth Pilotage Service passage plan, on which he had marked the proposed route across Plymouth Sound. The pilot and master discussed the vessel’s speed, and it was confirmed that the ship had two fixed propellers and a bow thruster. The master did not give the pilot a ship-specific pilot card, and he did not tell him that there were two steerable nozzles around the propellers which were linked to a single centreline rudder. This unusual steering arrangement was originally designed for this class of ship, to facilitate navigation on major rivers in the Soviet Union. However, these river ships now operate on ocean going routes. 

The engines were placed on full ahead, giving a speed of about 7.5 knots. The pilot made his routine reports to the VTS when passing Penlee Point and the breakwater. The master was stationed at the two telegraphs, and the chief officer acted as helmsman during the passage across the sound.  The pilot gave the helmsman courses to steer and direct helm orders. The two officers did not monitor the ship’s position either by radar or by electronic chart. A passage plan from the pilot station to the berth at Victoria Wharf had not been prepared by the ships’ officers. 

The ship left the Western Channel at the New Ground buoy and set a direct course towards the Cobbler Channel. The engines were slowed down to half ahead, giving a speed of about 4.5 knots. The pilot judged the ship’s progress across Plymouth Sound by observing the navigational lights of the buoys around Mallard Shoal, the end of Mount Batten Breakwater and Fisher’s Nose. As the ship travelled  across the Sound, she was set by the ebb tide to starboard to such an extent that she eventually passed very close to the end of Mount Batten Breakwater and on a heading of north. To make the turn into Cobbler Channel, the pilot gave increasing amounts of starboard helm, which included the nozzles, until it reached hard to starboard. The head needed to reach 048.5˚, and, realising that it was not turning quickly enough, the pilot asked for full ahead on the port engine, full astern on the starboard engine, and the bow thruster to full to starboard. He also ordered the pilot boat to push on the port bow. Although the head began to turn, it was apparent that the ship was closing the shore line immediately to the east of Fisher’s Nose Point, and the pilot asked for full astern on both engines. Midland 2 gently grounded forward on a mixture of mud and sand. However, the falling tide precluded refloatation attempts, even with the assistance of two tugs, until the tide had risen sufficiently enough after low water. A diving survey of the hull found that there was no damage to the ship.

When the duty engineer started changing over to a second filter, lubricating oil pressure was lost; causing the engine to stop and the ship to black-out. The engine was restarted and the passage was resumed. 
At 18.05 hours LT, the main engine low lubricating oil pressure alarm sounded again. At 20.00 hours LT, after further inspections had been undertaken, the chief engineer advised the master that the main engine could not be run due to probable bearing damage and that the ship would need to be towed to the nearest port for repairs. The main lubricating oil pump was also found, at this time, to have failed.

The ship was towed into Melbourne, arriving on 15 July, where all main and bottom end bearings were inspected. A large gouge mark was found on one bottom end bearing. 

Further investigations revealed that the gudgeon pin in number five piston had failed when a pre-existing, undetected flaw led to fatigue cracking of the gudgeon pin. The engine manufacturer had not provided sufficient guidance for monitoring the fatigue life of gudgeon pins or for inspecting gudgeon pins for cracks. 

The investigation also found that maintenance planning for the main lubricating oil pump was inadequate in that maintenance was not undertaken according to the manufacturers instructions, despite the fact that the pump had failed previously. 

The execution of routine maintenance on the lubricating oil filter was also inadequate in that the spare filter was not ready for use. The shipboard procedures did not identify the error and the procedures for operating and monitoring the filter were also ineffective.

1. According to the crew's investigation and opinions:

There was an adherence of a high-viscosity substance between all plungers and barrels, when the 1st. stick of FO pump racks had ocurred. It was therefore assumed that the start failure and sticking of the FO pump racks were caused by the adhesive substance, which created a rough surface on the plungers.

2. An overhaul was carried out (plungers and barrels were dismantled from each FO pump) and flashing for FO piping by MDO was finished.
All FO pump racks became smooth after all the plungers and barrels had been dismantled. Unit No. 5 was checked but no abnormal condition was found. (This was coinfirmed with C/E) The adherence of a high-viscosity substance was observed around the top of the plungers, as well as hard scales. The same problem was seen on the barrels and around the inner surface of the barrels. When the plungers were inserted into the barrels the movement of the plungers became very hard, and they could not be turned by hand.","TANKER","Ship remains fit to proceed","11690","Nippon Kaiji Kyokai (NKK)","19728","","","","","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","",""

An assessment was made to continue operations on a single engine until the vessel was relieved the following morning.  The casualty then made its way to an east Scottish port for repairs.  

On investigation it was found that the lubricating oil nipple at the top of the connecting rod had become blocked.  This cause the piston to overheat seizing it in the cylinder.

Two people were on board at the time : one crewman on deck aft, and the skipper in the forward wheelhouse.  The crewman shouted a warning to the skipper as water began to flood onto the deck aft as the vessel started to capsize to port.
Seawater began to flood through the wheelhouse door, threatening to trap the skipper inside, but the crewman made his way forward to the wheelhouse and pulled him clear.  The vessel then capsized rapidly to port and, as the men clambered onto the upturned hull, she sank by the stern, sucking the men under the water as she went down.
The men surfaced together and initially congratulated themselves on having survived the sinking.  They could see a large navigation buoy, DZ1, denoting the MOD firing range off Pendine beach, approximately 0.5 mile away, which they started to swim towards.  However, the tidal flow carried them away from the buoy.
Although the sea was calm, the water temperature was 12.7°C and the men began to tire as they continued to swim.  After some time, the crewman became exhausted and slipped below the water, but the skipper managed to pull him back to the surface and resuscitate him.  Later, the crewman went under for a second time, and although the skipper was again able to bring him back to the surface, the skipper was unable to resuscitate him and, as darkness fell, he had to leave him.  As he did so, he secured a plastic fender, which had floated free from the vessel, to the crewman's clothing and then started to swim towards a light he could see on the shore.  Extraordinarily, almost 10 hours after the sinking, the skipper staggered ashore at Pendine beach in the early hours of 18 June.  He was discovered by a member of the public, who fortuitously was a trained first-aider and who kept the skipper warm until medical assistance arrived.
Despite an extensive search for the crewman, his body was not found until 27 June when it was recovered from the water off Pendine beach.","Fish Catching Vessel","Loss of life,Total loss of the ship","3.42","","","","2","","","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","2008-09-25","2009-04-29"

Later that day, the master informed the ship’s charterer of the ‘incident’ and that the odour indicated that the packaging of the xanthates was not ‘gas-tight’, in accordance with international rules. He also asked for the containers to be discharged at Brisbane, the ship’s next port of call.
At 0411 on 18 June, the master reported the incident as a defect to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA). At 0720, the ship embarked a coastal pilot and started its transit of the Great Barrier Reef.
At 0907 on 19 June, AMSA issued a defect report and started collecting information about the incident. At 1252, the pilot disembarked from the ship after it had completed its transit of the northern part of the Great Barrier Reef Inner Route.
The ship berthed in Brisbane on 22 June after an ‘emergency’ was declared in the port. All eight xanthates containers on board the ship were discharged and purged with nitrogen gas to mitigate the risks posed by the foul smelling, highly flammable and toxic carbon disulphide vapours. On 24 June, the master was asked to reload the containers. He agreed on the condition that AMSA provide a written acceptance of the proposal with regard to ‘compliance’ with international rules.
By 04.00 hours LT on 25 June, the xanthates containers had been reloaded onto the ship before it sailed from Brisbane. On 6th July 2006 the ship discharged the last of the xanthates containers in Freemantle.

Loaded with ballast she had embarked a pilot for the outbound stage of the voyage.  The channel was narrow and mainly dried at low tide with the exception of a large 4 metre deep lake that remained at low tide.

Having left port the engineer felt that the engine was sounding ""rough"" and he informed the master of his concerns.  He then contacted the DPA to advise them of the situation.  The technical superintendent advised the captain to anchor and examine the main shaft thrust block.  

The engineer found that the oil in the trust block had become very heavily emulsified.  Because of the poor lubrication qualities the white metal faces of the thrust pads had wiped.  This caused the main shaft to move, and as the engine is directly connected to the propeller shaft the main engine main bearings wiped, scoring the crankshaft.

Further investigation revealed that the saltwater cooling coil in the bottom of the thrust block housing had suffered a leak.  This caused the oil to become emulsified destroying its lubricating properties.

It is noted that the coil was replaced by a Swedish yard as part of the refit package in October 2005.

The vessel was towed to Workington for engine inspection by the manufacturers, and the classification society.  The salvage association also conducted an investigation into the failure.  Following the engine assessment it is intended to tow the vessel to Birkenhead for full repairs.  

Both the master and chief engineer confirmed that there was no engine, thrust block or other alarms to raise their concern.  However, the engineers should have checked the level of the thrust block oil charge every 2 hours and there is no evidence to suggest they did.  Had they done so they may have noticed the increased level and emulsification and could possibly averted the damage.

The skipper's father called the emergency services, reporting the vessel overdue that evening after the families were unable to contact either the skipper or the crewman by telephone.
Over the next 36 hours an extensive air and sea search which involved numerous resources, including helicopters, a nimrod aircraft, lifeboats, fishing boats and auxiliary coastguard search teams, was carried out.  Just before midday on 3 June a local fishing boat reported that the missing boat had been found on the seabed just off Eilean Trodday.  A short while later they reported that a quick search of the wreck by a local diver had failed to find any sign of the trawler's crew.
The search for the missing crew was continued during that day and the following day.  It was called off 4 days after the boat had sailed from Gairloch.
The body of the crew member was found on the north-west coast of the Scottish mainland on 18 June, 17 days after the vessel had sunk.  However the skipper was still missing at the time of writing this report (January 2007).
It is believed the vessel probably grounded due to one of the crew falling asleep in the wheelhouse, which allowed the vessel to sail past her intended fishing grounds and onto the shore at Eilean Trodday.  Both crew would have been suffering the effects of fatigue brought on by a number of long days at work, with only short, broken sleep periods.

The most probable cause of the sinking was the cargo of cement shifting as the ship rolled - the sum of the angle of roll of the vessel and the angle of repose of some of the untrimmed surface of the cargo must have exceeded 30o, allowing part of the cement to shear off and slide to the starboard side, amplifying and accelerating the rolling motion. With this gravity shifted to starboard, the vessel could not roll back upright.
The Chief Officer and the Second Engineer both lost their lives.

The ship was heading for fishing grounds off the south west coast of Ireland, where it had been operated by its previous owners. 
At about 20:00 hours (UTC 22:00 ships time) on 24 May 2006, a call was made from the “Dinish” to La Coruna Radio saying that the ship was taking in water. The crew reported flooding in the engine room and attempts were made by the crew to control the level of flooding, however these efforts were unsuccessful.
Two liferafts were launched from the ship and six of the crew got in to one raft.
At approximately 20:30 hours (22:30 ships time) the ship capsized and sank about 170 miles south west of the Scilly Isles.
Rescue services were tasked along with other merchant ship close to the last known position of the “Dinish”.  Six survivors were taken on board the merchant ship “Stena Contest” from one of the rafts and the Skipper of the “Dinish” was taken from the water by the merchant ship “Stolt Capability”. One other crewmember was taken from the water by a rescue helicopter and pronounced dead on arrival at Cork University Hospital. A search operation was mounted; however the remaining two crewmembers are not accounted for.

During an onboard investigation, the  cause of the leak was found to be a small crack between the No. 12 starboard side fuel tank and the topside water ballast tank No. 6/7. Fuel had leaked into the ballast tank, and subsequently flowed into the inlet/oulet pipe, and because this pipe´s valve was open, fuel leaked into the sea causing the oil slick. The valve from the ballast tank inlet/outlet pipe was shut immediately, and a stopper was put on the pipe.
The Captain appeared in the local court on May 12th, and was fined 500 pounds. The crack was temporarily repaired by steel with a rubber seal. The repairs were inspected and passed by class surveyor and Port Control surveyor.

Initial action by the watchkeeping engineer officer was effective in eventually extinguishing the fire although the vessel lost all but emergency electrical power and was left drifting in the south-west lane of the Dover Straits Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS), 16 miles south of Beachy Head.  The vessel's starboard main engine had been very seriously damaged and she was towed to the port of Southampton by a Maritime and Coastguard Agency's emergency towing vessel.
The subsequent investigation discovered that the fire had been caused by a failed low pressure fuel pipe flange on the starboard Wartsila Vasa32 main engine.  The lack of an effective guard allowed fuel to spray onto the adjacent turbocharger and/or exhaust piping causing spontaneous ignition.  
During the investigation into the cause of the fire, after the vessel's arrival in Southampton, CO2 from a bank of cylinders was accidentally released into the engine room.  In the event, three crew were lucky to escape without loss of life or serious injury.","PASSENGER","Ship rendered unfit to proceed","11162","Lloyd's Register (LR)","1965","","246","462","","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","2008-09-17","2009-04-29"

The error was not noticed initially and by the time maximum port helm was applied at 1441, grounding was inevitable. Soon after, the pilot ordered both anchors to be let go and the main engine to be run at emergency full astern in an attempt to reduce the effects of the impact. At 1442, the ship grounded on Long Tom Reef as the port anchor was let go and the main engine run astern. 

The ship, with its main engine running astern, moved off the reef and refloated at 1446. An attempt to retrieve the anchor resulted in the failure of the port windlass. The ship remained anchored until 1605 when two tugs arrived to assist. The anchor cable was cut and left in the river with the port anchor. The ship then returned to the Bell Bay anchorage with the assistance of the tugs. 

An inspection of the ship revealed that it was severely damaged and that temporary repairs could not be carried out in Bell Bay.

The ship was fitted with two portable bulkheads that could be moved within the hold in order to divide the space up into three sections.
After sailing from Southampton, the ship's two Able Bodied Seamen (ABs) were tasked to thoroughly clean the cargo hold before arrival in Teignmouth.  To achieve this, there was no requirement to move the bulkheads from their existing longitudinal positions, but both had to be vertically raised to ensure that all remaining traces of the previous cargo were completely removed; this was normal practice for this trade.  While cleaning beneath the bulkheads, they were supported by timber packing.
The ballast passage was made in good weather conditions, and when the ship arrived off Teignmouth the cleaning was almost completed.  The two ABs assisted with anchoring the vessel and then returned to the hold to finish the task.
Working at the forward face of the aft most bulkhead, the ABs used two separate, portable, hand powered jacks to lift vertically the aft bulkhead off its temporary supports; one jack was operated by each AB.
One AB stopped operating his jack and stepped through the opening in the bulkhead to the aft side.  Almost immediately, the bulkhead began to topple, rotating about its lower locating pins so that its top edge moved aft.  The bulkhead continued to fall aft, generally rotating about the lower pins until they, too, became disengaged and the bulkhead fell to the deck.
The AB working on the forward side escaped uninjured.  Tragically, the second AB was fatally crushed between the fallen bulkhead and the bottom of the hold.

It was concluded that there was a serious fire inside the EGE. The vessel was immediately stopped, and the EGE cooled with copious quantities of water spray. At 15.26 hours LT  it was noticed that the vessel had listed about 1.0 deg to port, & water levels in E/R bilges were near floor plate level. The rise in water level was rapid & alarming due to copious amount of water being used for fighting fire in the EGE. Due to Vessel's List & Trim condition,  & as the water was reaching the floor plate in aft area, it was necessary to lower the water level by using the Fire & G.S. pump which has direct suction from the aft bilges. Any further rise in water levels would have led to sloshing of water with rolling/ pitching & probable damage to machineries in the vicinity which would have incapacitated the vessel. All possible openings for air inlet were checked, viz. scavenge drain, stuffing box drain, indicator cocks, soot collection drain, drains for EGE section, M/E exhaust pipe and Turbochargers and all were confirmed shut.  Cooling down of the EGE with five fire hoses was continued till 26th April 06.24 hours LT  to avoid any recurrence of fire. The temperatures were then observed to be 80deg centigrade on the outer side of EGE, & inlet was 26/32 degrees centigrade. By 26th April at 07.08 hours LT the manhole for the EGE was opened and inspected internally & it was confirmed that there was no smoke or hotspot or fire inside the EGE.

Soon afterwards, the pilot asked the master to let go the forward tug Tenax, which had its tow line fast to a bollard on the starboard side, just aft of the forward mooring station. The pilot also told the tug master by VHF radio to let go. 

The pilot’s instruction was relayed by the ship’s internal VHF radio to the Bosun, who, with three able seamen and a deck cadet, went quickly to the tow line. They looked over the side of the ship and saw that there was some slack in the line, but no crew was on the tug’s deck. Therefore, a signal from the tug was not given that it was ready to receive the tow line. An able seaman, the bosun and another able seaman stood in line between the panama lead and the bollard and began to pull the slack of the tow line in by hand. 

Meanwhile on the tug, the chief engineer moved the towing winch control joystick to pay out the line and to give the ship’s crew some more slack. However, when he looked up at the CCTV monitor, he saw that the line was being heaved in onto the winch. He looked down at the towing winch control panel and saw that the tensioning mode switch was still illuminated. He switched the tensioning mode switch off, which gave him control of the joystick and he was able to pay the tow line out. 

When the tow line tightened, the able seaman who was standing nearest the panama lead, had his hands drawn towards the lead. He managed to extract his right hand, but his left hand was badly crushed when it became caught between the tow line and the panama lead. His hand was released when the tug’s chief engineer slackened off the tow line.

Dampier Spirit’s master had delayed making the decision to disconnect from the CALM buoy when a cyclone, centred 200 miles from the ship, was declared. His decision may have been delayed because of ambiguities in the company’s decision guidelines, the procedures did not accurately reflect the ship’s ability to sail away from danger, the Stag platform was still discharging crude oil into the ship’s cargo tanks and the ship had safely remained at the buoy during a previous cyclone:
After the ship had separated from the buoy, it had difficulty in manoeuvring away from the area because the performance of the ship was reduced by the ‘slow steaming’ fuel injector nozzles fitted in the main engine and by the build-up of barnacle and coral growth on the hull.
The ship was tracking towards Tryal Rocks until the wind eased, allowing it to sail into safer water. If Dampier Spirit had grounded on Tryal Rocks, its 12 100 tonnes of crude oil cargo may have been spilled into the sea, resulting in significant damage to the environmentally sensitive mangroves and turtle nesting grounds in the area.

There was a force 7 from the south, the sea was rough and there was a 4 metre southerly swell running.  At14.50 hours the engine low oil level alarm sounded and the Ch Eng confirmed the level was dropping and this was followed by a falling oil pressure alarm.  He alerted the master and recommended that the engine be stopped.  Because of the navigational situation and the risk of being blown onto the shore the master kept the engine running.  The master activated the First Response Call System to alert the DPA of the situation.  The DPA immediately made arrangements for 2 tugs to proceed to the scene.  The Master alerted the CG 55 minutes after the failure.  In the meantime the engineers decanted oil from the storage tank to the engine until it was eventually stopped by the master at 16.10 hours.  He was told tug support would arrive in 10 hours.  The anchors were prepared for letting go.

The CG activated 2 lifeboats and an Irish Navy vessel to assist.  The LB arrived at 19.10 hours and connected a tow line which was transferred to the IN vessel soon after.  When connecting the line the Ch Officer badly strained his back.   Soon after midnight the 2 tugs arrived and took the tow, the supporting vessels were then released.  The vessel was eventually secured at Great Island at 13.45 hours the following day.

Subsequent investigation revealed that the scavenge oil pump drive had sheared under excessive torsional load and that the gearwheel pump had been jammed with metal debris.  This caused the drive pinion to fall into the sump which damaged No1 cylinder liner, fracturing the sump and causing the oil loss.

It was a clear and bright day and on arrival at 14.30 hours LT the wind was north-easterly between 30 - 35 knots. The mooring arrangements at forward and aft used a mix of ropes and wires for the same function i.e. breast and spring  lines.  The wires were left on the winch drums with the drum disconnected from the winch drive shaft, the band brakes were on, the control lever in neutral and hydraulic pumps shut down. This procedure was normal and accepted practice.  
The forward and after mooring ropes, were secured in a different manner.  The forward mooring party used ropes on bights and left them on the winch warping drum so that equal rope tension to that of the wire could be achieved.  The ropes were then backed up on bitts with figure of eight turns.  The after mooring party used a different method which resulted in an expensive and potentially dangerous accident.  The single, after ropes were also secured on the drum ends but only backed up with just a couple of turns around a single bitt.
The captain received reports from the mooring decks that the ship was ""all fast forward"" and all ""fast aft"".  There was no positive reporting on the status of the winches or of the types and number of lines used.  Unfortunately the practice of having an officer supervising the moorings had also fallen into abeyance and no one in authority checked the moorings despite the very windy and obviously risky conditions.  The master was able to view the forward moorings from the bridge but the after moorings were obscured.  There was an assumption that the after moorings were the same as the satisfactory ones forward. At18.10 hours LT, the bridge received a report that one of the stern line wires had ""stranded"" and that the on-watch deck team intended to replace it.  
A replacement wire was not sent out before removing the damaged one.  The damaged wire had been removed from the jetty bollard and work was underway to detach the wire from the winch drum when the chief officer arrived at the after mooring deck.  Unfortunately the opportunity to check the other moorings and the suitability the remaining single stern line to take the load was not taken. At about 1835 another ferry entered the port. The ship surged about 15 feet up the jetty and the remaining stern line parted and the ship's stern started to leave the quay.  The ship pivoted about the forward port shoulder causing one of the forward breast ropes to part.  As the ship continued to move off the quay the port after winch brakes rendered and the wires were pulled from the winch wire drums.  As weight came onto the after ropes they were pulled from around the loose turns around the single bitts, rotated the winch warping drum which in turn rotated the winch hydraulic motor backwards.  This huge shock loading pressurised the motor casings and they fractured under the excessive pressure spraying hydraulic oil across the port after winch deck.  
The ship adopted an angle of about 45 degrees to the jetty before a nearby tug was raised on VHF and came to the ferry's assistance and pushed her back alongside.

The movement of water nevertheless caused the vessel to surge along the jetty initiating the Emergency Shut Down which tripped the cargo pumps and closed the Emergency Shut down (ESD) valves on the ship and ashore.  At the same time both forward spring lines parted at their tails.  Shortly afterwards the ESD 2 was initiated.  All Powered Emergency Release Couplings (PERCs) released the hard arms from the ship.

Immediately afterwards the 2 forward breast lines parted as the tugs then pushed the vessel alongside. The accident resulted in both gangways being destroyed but there was no other damage and no injuries.  Cargo discharge commenced some 12 hours later.

The USCG issued a Marine Safety Bulletin setting out the Policy for LNG Tankship Operations although a maximum passing speed was not specified.  As of the 19 April 2006 the USCG were continuing their investigations focusing on the actions of the passing vessel.","","Ship remains fit to proceed","95879","DNV AS (DNV)","66200","LNG","","","","","","","","","","",""

On a routine basis, four crew members would be employed on the alt deck of the stern trawler carrying out the work processes required in preparation for putting out the trawl. The Master navigated the ship. At the same time, he operated the various winches from the control position located in the aft part of the bridge.  This position provided him with the best possible overview of the aft deck. 
While handling the trawl gear as required for setting the trawl, suddenly and contrary to the regular procedure, an extremely high line tension came about at the aft midships guide roller.  A deckhand, who for an unexplained reason was in the danger area not visible from the bridge between the vertical guide roller and the tightening lines, was caught by the lines and pressed with a great force against the guide roller. During the process he suffered severe injuries in the chest area, which resulted in his death shortly of immediately implemented first aid measures and direct contact with the radio medical advisory service. A rescue helicopter alreafu dispatched to the Jan Maria was thereupon recalled from the control centre.
The Jan Maria discontinued the setting procedure immediately after the accident and headed for the Irish fishing port of Killybegs, which it reached at approximately 14:00 on 14 March 2006.

Departure drafts fore 2.1m aft 5.6m.
At 15.57 hours LT while she was passing Buoy 45G, she changed course to 3380 and at that time a vessel was sighted in radar sailing in the downriver direction and heading towards the ""ESTELLA"". This vessel´s course was 151o.
""ESTELLA"" passed abeam buoy 46R at 16 02 hrs LT and altered course to 310 and established visual contact with ""CAPTAIN  P"". at a distance of about 3.8 miles.
There were attempts to communicate with the other vessel through VHF channels 14+16. These attempts were unsuccessful, as the other vessel did not respond. Attempts to communicate continued unsuccessfully while the ""ESTELLA"" was passing buoy 49.
At 16 11 hrs LT while the vessel was abeam of Buoy 49, the course was changed on pilot´s orders to 318o. Calling on VHF and blowing of whistle continued. The vessel´s horn was used with continuous sounds and at the same time continuous attempts to make contact through the VHF radio were carried out without success.
At 16 15 hrs LT while the vessel was abeam of buoy 51, the pilot ordered the helmsman hard to starboard because the other vessel was coming at a high speed  directly towards the ""ESTELLA`S"" ahead.
In an effort to avoid collision the pilot then ordered hard to port but in the meantime at 16 16 hrs LT the other vessel, wich was the ""CAPTAIN P"", struck the starboard side of the ""ESTELLA"" with her bulbous bow in way of No. 5, 6, 7 & 8 and tanks  at high speed, as can be seen from the severe damage to the ""ESTELLA"" shell plating, wich was ruptured open from No. 5 tank to No. 8 tanks. The bulbous bow of the ""CAPTAIN P"" hit the starboard side shell of ""ESTELLA"" initially in way of No. 5 stbd cargo tank at an angle of blow of 30º; but because of her speed and construction of bulbous bow (ice class) she continued her movement tearing off the side shell plating, rupturing the shell and creating a rupture of 35 meters in total length from the bottom plating bilge straight up to and including the deck plating wich was ruptured buckled and set in. All internal strengthening in way, including web section frames vertical and longitudinal frames corrugated tank bulkheads and longitudinal bulkheads between side and centre  tanks were destroyed by the force of the impact generated by the angle and speed of the ""CAPTAIN P"" wich in essence rammed the ""ESTELLA"".
As a result of the collision the following tanks were breached and are open to the sea;
-     Nos. 5, 6, 7, 8 stbd side cargo tanks
-     Centre Nos. 7 & 8 cargo tanks
-     Slop tank starboard side
-     No. 1 Double bottom fuel oil tank

The vessel took a list to starboard.
The collision ocurred at position: Lat 04º 35.92N - 007 10.46E.
AT 16.18 hrs LT the ""CAPTAIN P"" disengaged herself from the ""ESTELLA"" by an astern movement.
At 16 20 hrs LT ""ESTELLA"" dropped her port anchor at a location near by at position Lat 04º  35.86N - Long 007º 10.46E.

SPRUCE was alongside at Victoria harbour, Hartlepool.  The vessel had completed the discharge of a full load of barges and was then deballasted to her usual seagoing condition of 4.25m draught even keel.
The incident occurred during the recovery of the vessel's portable gangway shortly before SPRUCE was due to let go her ropes and sail from the port.  The injured person was assisting in this operation, although he was not trained for working on deck.
The operation to recover the gangway was labour intensive; five members of crew were used to manhandle the gangway up the side of the vessel to the main deck where the stowage position was located.   The vessel was originally fitted with a method of retrieval for a fixed gangway, but this had been cropped and removed a number of years previously.
The minimum number of deck and engine personnel required by the vessel's Minimum Safe Manning Certificate (SMC) were insufficient for mooring operations and supplementary tasks.  It was necessary for the cook and the steward (who were not included on the SMC) and motermen to assist on deck at times of peak workload.
On SPRUCE, the working regime relied on a system of Inter-Departmental Flexibility, but this had not been accounted for when determining the crew numbers under the SMC or when developing the ship's safety management system.

At around 19.10 hours LT the vessel started to drag anchor and the master decided to head out to the open sea.  At 19.15 hours LT the vessel was cleared by the port control authorities to proceed out to sea, the anchor was heaved up and the master tried to steer the vessel on a heading out to sea.  During these manoeuvres at 20.25 hours LT, the vessel experienced difficulties in keeping her course because of the effects of the weather.  Some time later, the master realised that his vessel was in risk of hitting an anchored vessel.  As she was not responding to the helm because of the weather, the master decided to drop the starboard anchor and apply full astern on the main engine to avoid a collision.  His intentions were to have the wind and sea swing his vessel round and then proceed out to the open sea.  After some time the vessel turned around into the wind and the master heaved up the anchor and headed out to the open sea.

During this manoeuvring the vessel came to a position close to the shoreline and again was experiencing difficulties in keeping on course due to the weather, which by now had worsened.  The master decided to repeat the same manoeuvre and dropped the starboard anchor in an attempt to swing the vessel into the wind.

The VTS station advised the vessel to standby for further instructions via VHF.

At 05.30 hours LT, the VTS station called the vessel and informed the chief mate that the passage was not scheduled for that day and that they were to proceed to an anchorage area, 16 miles Northeast of Gelibolu lighthouse.

The vessel at the time was 13 miles from Gelibolu lighthouse and was instructed to alter course to the indicated anchorage area.  The master decided to wait for some more time before turning back to enable the vessel’s engineers to change over from heavy oil to diesel oil.

At 06.10 hours LT, the master ordered the helmsman to put the wheel hard to starboard and the vessel started to turn around to starboard away from the traffic separation zone.  At 06.21 hours LT, as the vessel had almost completed the 180 degree turn, she made contact with the bottom and lost all forward speed.

The main engine was stopped and the VTS station was informed of the grounding.  Attempts to refloat the vessel by own power failed and a salvage company was contracted to assist the vessel which was re-floated with the assistance of two tugs on 01 March 2006 at 18.00 hours LT.

Stbd hull was holed midships, approximately 0.1m x 2m in stbd pump room.  Compartment was flooded, requiring 350 tonnes counter flooding in port ballast tanks to keep vessel upright. Cooling pumps flooded leading to loss of stbd generators.  Position of vessel confirmed in accordance with passage plan by ECDIS, VDR and VTS playback.  Damage thought due to uncharted obstruction.  Vessel alongside 20-30 mins late, all passengers disembarked safely; no injuries, no pollution.  Sidescan and bathymetric survey of inner harbour planned to commence 19/20 Feb.

Investigation received from Safety Manager indicates that the vessel had recently been fitted with new bridge systsem.  The IAS, GPS and ECDIS clocks had not been synchronized and the electronic charts had not had danger areas highlighted.  The vessel conducted its turn about 50 further south than normal, but there should have been adequate depth of water.  Sidescan and diver surveys found several boulders, but none were considered large enough to have caused the damage.  No signs of paint or scraping were found.  

The company has now marked danger areas on its charts and included clock synchronization in daily checklists.  An operational memo has been published warning of the dangers of squat at speeds over 10kts.  The harbour authority will complete sidescan surveys every 3 months over the coming year to ensure a safe minimum depth is being maintained

16.25 UTC: The Neyland Point beacon came in contact with the port side of the vessel at a distance of apprx 30 mtrs from the bow and continued to scrape past the port side for a length approximately 20 meters. The tug had by then stopped pushing & had fallen astern of the ship by slacking the tug's line which was on a winch drum on the tug, however the tug could not be cast off at that instance as the tug line was very heavy. The stern passed clear of the Neyland Point beacon with a clearance of 3 meters.

The damage to the ship was limited to a couple of paint scratches of approximately 20 meters length on the port side and damaged hand rail below the Port side Passenger access door. The beacon had her platform & guardrails damaged on the side of contact with the ship.

16.27 UTC: Engines were stopped to check for any damages but no serious damages observed and vessel proceeded to berth.
16.48 UTC: First line ashore.
17.42: All fast & finished with Engines after positioning & lowering of stern ramp. Tug was cast off, Pilot away & Agent onboard.
18.15 UTC: Harbour master onboard and discussed the event with Master. Charts were checked & vessel position verified. Damage to the ship was noted. It was agreed between the Harbour Master & the Vessel Master that a soft glancing contact was made between the vessel & the beacon with no serious damage done to either & the vessel was cleared to sail on completion of cargo.
Harbour Master requested a Statement Of Facts from the vessel to be sent to the local agent of the Vessel after sailing.
18.45 UTC: Harbour Master disembarked from the vessel.

21.18 UTC: Vessel sailed out of Pembroke after discharging her cargo.

At around 19.00  hours LT, as the last part of the catch was being tackled in, the ship suddenly heeled to starboard.
The skipper, who was handling the tackle winch from the deck, immediately eased out the winch. The ship did not get back on an even keel, but found balance for a brief moment with the rail under water.
The skipper engaged the propeller and swung the ship around in an attempt to get the sea from aft in order to minimize the list. This was done without any positive result and the ship capsized. 
The skipper managed to get out of the wheelhouse.
The two others crewmembers, who were on the deck amidships, got caught under the shelter deck but they managed to get out.
Together they managed to disengage the life raft from its stowing position on the top of the wheelhouse and to release it. The ship’s second man drifted away while they were working with the life-raft and the others lost contact with him in the dark. 
The water was very cold, and none of the crewmembers had had the time to put on life jackets or immersion suits.
The skipper and the 3rd man entered the life raft and managed to release it from the ship.
The Danish Admiral Fleet was alarmed by the ship’s EPIRB and a search and rescue operation was initiated.

The Danish Admiral Fleet tried to establish contact with the ship via Lyngby Ra-dio. As the ship did not reply to the calls, ships and a rescue helicopter began searching for the ship.

The skipper and the ship’s 3rd man were rescued from the raft by the helicopter approximately 1½ hours after the ship’s EPIRB had been activated.

Shortly after, the ship’s 2nd man was found dead.

Vessel's draft was 47 ft. When the vessel approached one (1) mile from College Point, where the river makes a U-turn, a tug boat pushing seven barges (approximate length 350 metres) was observed visually and on radar screen. The direction of the tow was at approximately 45° angle to the riverside, thus resulting to the restriction of navigable waters (depth over 50 ft). The pilot and the Master attempted several times to speak with the tug master calling him in the appropriate frequency in VHF and using the vessel's whistle, with negative results. In order to avoid collision with the tow and as there was not any better alnernative, due to restricted waters (1,5 cable), limited time and constraint in vessel's manoeuvrability the pilot advised the Master to  start making a sharper strbd turn which resulted in the vessel's pulling out of the bend earlier than the normal.

At 03.00 hours LT the vessel was in position at the berth and berthing manoeuvres were almost completed, with two head ropes and two springs forward and two stern ropes and two springs aft.  The attending port pilot received instructions from the terminal to shift the vessel approximately 8 metres astern due to operational reasons.

To carry out this movement at the aft station, one stern line and one spring were paid out from the vessel’s side and the corresponding two others were kept on the winch drums.The second mate, who was in charge of organising and monitoring the mooring operations at the aft station, was at the time standing on the port side open roller chock.  As soon as the spring was released from the vessel’s side, he tried to stop it with his left foot, while his right foot remained on the fore roller.

The spring was by then paying out with a high velocity due to the vessel’s movement.  When the second mate put his foot on the rope to stop it, his foot was swept away by the rope’s speedy movement in the direction of the second spring, which was running through the mooring fore roller entrapping his foot between the two springs.

The second mate tried desperately to pull his foot clear by using his right leg.  In doing so, both legs were entrapped between the spring ropes and the rollers.  The mooring roller chocks have a steel pipe welded around the chock assembly to prevent the ropes from slipping out of the chocks.  The second mate’s feet were caught between the rope/chock/pipe combination and he suffered serious injuries to one of his feet, resulting in the instant loss of one foot and serious injuries to the other.

The master who was on the bridge wing, heard the shouting from the poop deck and tried to stop the vessel from going astern by ordering slow ahead on the main engine, but by this time the second mate was already seriously injured. The able seaman, who was operating the winch, released the tension on the spring by paying out the winch drum and the second officer was released from the ropes.  The crewmembers started to administer first aid.  An ambulance was called and at 04.00 hours LT the second mate was taken to the Rosario City hospital.

On 19 January 2006 the second mate succumbed to his injuries at the hospital and died.","BULK CARRIER","Loss of life,Serious injuries","22992","Lloyd's Register (LR)","38584","Dry bulk","22","0","0","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","",""

At 11h35 on 8th January, the Master tried to send a message to the local agent in Sfax to inform him about the delay in ETA owing to rough weather when the vessel was hit by a wave.  When the Master looked outside, he noticed that the main deck was completely under water.  The vessel started listing.  At 11h40 SUSANN experienced a black out.  The ship's generator failed and the emergency generator also failed to start automatically.  Manual starting of main generator was impossible due to the huge starboard list (nearly 50 degrees to starboard).
Distress messages were sent by the Master when it became apparent that SUSANN should be abandonned.  Assistance was requested and all crew boarded the liferafts and were later picked up by a rescue helicopter and a navy ship.

The general cargo Star Herdla is in the South-West Lane of the Dover Strait Tss, course made good 108°, speed 11.3 knots heading to Boulogne-sur-Mer approaches.
The visibility varies from five to one cable.
The Cape Bradley after ""South-East Ridens"" buoy alters course made good to 020°, in line with the lane. The OOW, supported by an AB as helmsperson, sees on the radar display several ship contacts, both on port and starboard sides, transiting in the same direction and one contact on the port side heading 108°, thus ""crossing"". 
At the same time, Star Herdla is close to begin to cross the North-East Lane. The master, supported by the Chief Officer, the OOW and an AB as helmsperson, observes on the radar display five contacts heading in the North-East Lane on his right hand side at various ranges. He alters course to the right in order to pass on the aft of the two first. At 07:15 hours, the three other ships are all about on the same parallel at the range of about 1.6 mile. Star Herdla can cross on the bow of Cape Bradley, which is among these ships with a CPQ of 0.21 mile. Anyway the Master keeps on turning right to course 160°, likely to pass on Cape Bradley port side and then to cross on her aft. At an estimated range of 0.6 or 0.7 mile from her the master suddenly decides a hard to port manoeuvre at a speed of 10 knots. 
Both ships, Cape Bradley maintaining her speed and shyly altering her course to port side, and Star Herdla during a hard to port manoeuvre collided in the French territorial waters between 07:19 and 07:20 hours at position 50°45.447 N and 001°22.8543 E, that is in the bearing 296° from Cape Alprech at 7.9 miles.
The collision angle between the two ships is about 90°. On Star Herdla the impact is on the aft of the starboard side at the gangway level. On Cape Bradley the impact is at the bow
For Star Herdla the immediate consequence is a blackout leading to the loss of the main engine. Star Herdla is adrift in the North-East Lane without any manoeuvring capacity. Cape Bradley, after the collision keeps her course in the North-East Lane with a slower speed.

A large number of airborne and nautical resources were deployed during 05 January in an effort to locate other survivors and toestablish which ships were likely to have been in the area when the accident occurred.

The wreck of the Klein Familie was pinpointed and identified on 06 January by a French Navy minesweeper and a team of divers was sent down to ascertain  whether any bodies remained on board  and to make a  description of the wreck  for the technical investigators of the Beamer and  the legal authorities.

The pilot planned to enter the port to the west of the track marked by the main leading lights, to keep the ship out of an opposing tidal flow for as long as possible. When the ship was almost abeam of Point Lonsdale Lighthouse, the pilot thought he could see the high and low main leading lights just open to the west. This indicated to him that the ship was on the edge of the Great Ship Channel. However, the ship was further to the west than the pilot thought. 

The ship continued the transit and anchored at 1154. No one on board the ship observed anything that might have suggested that the ship had grounded during the pilotage. 

At about 1245, the chief mate found the level in the lower fore peak water ballast tank rising. He told the master, and they decided to pump out the tank and inspect it. The inspection revealed that the tank’s shell plating had been holed. 

The ship berthed in Geelong on 5 January and temporary repairs were carried out before it sailed for Singapore on 19 January, where it was dry-docked for permanent repairs.

The investigation found that the ship probably grounded at about 0825, when it was almost abeam of Point Lonsdale, while transiting from sea to the Melbourne outer anchorage.
