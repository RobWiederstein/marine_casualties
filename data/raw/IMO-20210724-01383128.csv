The Christopher caught up with the clipper Miki in the Königsförde siding. The pilots of the two ships discussed the overtaking manoeuvre in the next main siding, Audorf-Rade, over VHF. However, the course of the overtaking manoeuvre in the main siding was such that the two ships were next to each other as they  passed a narrowing of the canal’s cross-section. At the same time, the Christopher was pushed away due to hydrodynamic effects between the ship and bank, which caused her to turn to starboard and ram the Clipper Miki.

Significant material damage was caused to both ship, but nobody came to physical harm and the environment was not polluted. After the crews had finished inspecting the damage, it was decided to allow the two ships to continue to Brunsbüttel.

The HGV trailer's slot position was on the outer right parking lane of deck 4 on the starboard side at the front parking position.  The MECKLENBURG-VORPOMMERN was incoming on the maritime canal of the international port of the Hanseatic City of Rostock when the fire broke out.  Due to the early discovery of the source of the fire, the immediate initiation of the firefighting operation, coupled with the favourable slot position of the HGV trailer and the proximity to the port facility, the fire was controlled and any further damage was prevented.  At 2216 hrs, the fire was fully extinguished. 
Fire experts concluded that a technical fault probably triggered the fire and that a VW transporter situated on the load space of the trailer had caught fire.

Quatre hommes sont à bord : les trois hommes d’équipage et un passager (non déclaré).

Vers 23 :00 hrs, le patron revient en timonerie pour contrôler la position du navire et le mouillage, alors que les autres marins sont déjà couchés. La tenue au mouillage étant bonne, il descend à son tour se coucher dans le poste équipage. Le moteur et ses auxiliaires attelés restent en marche, mais les alarmes des appareils de navigation ne sont, semble-t-il, pas en service. Entre minuit et 1h00, l’équipage est réveillé par le bruit d’un paquet de mer ayant déferlé sur le pont ; le navire se couche brutalement sur tribord. Les quatre hommes regagnent avec difficulté la timonerie. D’autres paquets de mer frappent le navire et le pont est envahi. Craignant un chavirement imminent, le patron arrache la porte de la timonerie, déjà bloquée par la pression de l’eau sur tribord, et plonge vers l’extérieur, suivi du mécanicien. Le matelot et le passager restent un moment dans la timonerie qui se remplit d’eau, puis l’évacuent également. Les trois marins perdront rapidement le passager de vue. Bien qu’exténués, ils rejoindront finalement le rivage à la nage, mais le mécanicien décèdera peu après et son corps sera emporté par les rouleaux.
Le corps du passager et du mécanicien seront retrouvés après plusieurs jours de recherches.

The accident happened during daylight in the afternoon hours of 11 November 2010 during bad weather conditions with rough sea. 
Three crew were rescued.
The tug was about to assist the British flag vessel Ro Ro Stena Britannia while being in process to getting berthed. 
Fairplay-22 approached the bow of Stena Britannia to pass a heaving line to get the rope connection established. When this failed Fairplay-22 in a second try came closer towards the bow of Stena Britannia where she was hit by the bulbous bow of Stena Britannia and slipped around. 
Fairplay-22 listed heavily and finally capsized rapidly when the bulb of Stena Britannia cracked into the schottel pod of the tug while she was pushed ahead in her 
already critical list. 
A fast rescue operation was mounted by the local rescue centre together with the Coastguard, who employed helicopter and airplane beside boats and water rescue equipment. A sheerleg floating crane was called to raise the tug; however, the salvage was hampered by winds of about 110 km/h. 
The dead body of one of the missing crew was found a day later drifted towards the shore. The master, however, who was missed as well, was only found dead later when the tug had been salvaged already.
The deteriorating impact on the surrounding environment close to the accident site was marginal because only a minimal amount of Diesel and lub oil was spilled from the sunken tug.

The two flag States involved (Antigua and Barbuda/UK) and the Netherlands, being substantially interested as coastal State, have mutually agreed to conduct a joint investigation with the Netherlands leading. 

An interim information report was agreed to be released by the Netherlands authorities periodically while the investigation is in process. A first one issued revealed that the human factor may have triggered this fatal casualty. The current standing of the case study gives cause to assume that there appears to be a lack of awareness of all the risks and dangers of operation of tugs very near to moving ships during the phase of fastening towing lines (see page 2/3 of De Onderzoeksraad Voor Veiligheid letter 10 March 2011).

The terminal/receiver in Oxelösund required that the cargo had to have a temperature of 45°C before discharging.

When approaching the area of Oxelösund, contact was established with the VTS on the morning of 8 November on VHF channel 9. The ship was advised by the VTS to drop anchor at anchorage “B” but the master onboard Chantaco informed the VTS that he intended to anchor N of N Kränkan due to coming bad weather. 

Oxelösund VTS agreed that the ship could use the inner anchorage since the area of the anchorage is outside the area of compulsory pilotage.

At 08:30 hrs Chantaco dropped anchor in position N 58° 37,’75  E 017° 22,’58 (about 6 cables east of Hörngrund) with six shackles on deck. 

Due to the increasing winds during late afternoon the master decided to increase the length of the anchor chain to eight shackles on deck.

On 9 November at 02:00 hrs, the officer on watch noticed that the ship started dragging her anchor. He immediately called the captain and informed him about the situation and a few seconds later he called the engineer on watch, bosun and one AB.

Chantaco dragged with a speed of about 1.5 knots in a west-southwesterly direction heading north, with the wind and sea on her starboard side, toward Hörngrund. At around 02:10 hrs, she dragged aground in position N 58° 37,’74  E 017°21,’66 just before the bridge had the engine control.

En route to Walvis Bay in Namibia the ship called at Luanda, but due to the lack of medical resources in this port, the AB was not sent ashore for medical attention in Luanda. 

After departing Luanda, the AB’s condition deteriorated further and the master decided to sign off the AB upon the ship’s arrival in Walvis Bay, Namibia. The master came in doubt whether the AB was fit to be transported to his home by airplane, and he arranged for AB to be taken to a local hospital for examination before being considered fit for repatriation.

When the ship arrived in Walvis Bay, the AB was submitted to the local hospital in the afternoon of 4 November 2010. The ship owner local agent reported that, during the examination and interviews with the medical personnel at the hospital, the AB was very aggressive. The doctors decided to keep the AB in the hospital for observation. In the morning of 5 November 2010, the AB’s condition deteriorated further, and the AB died at 07:30 hrs local time.

Radio Medical was not contacted during the course of events.

Peu avant 20h00, le KRASNODAR sort du DST des Casquets et vient au 240° pour poursuivre sa route vers le DST de Ouessant. Une fois le changement de cap effectué et la situation claire, le commandant passe la suite au troisième lieutenant et
quitte la passerelle.
A bord du navire de pêche, après s’être fait remplacer et avoir pris un rapide repas, le patron rejoint la passerelle à 20h50.
Un quart d’heure plus tard, le CAP FRÉHEL se trouve droit devant le KRASNODAR, à environ 1,5 mille. Sur la passerelle du pétrolier, les hommes de quart n’identifient ni ne suivent le navire de pêche ; ils sont accaparés par un navire de charge sur leur tribord qui fait route au Sud/Est. Alors que le CAP FRÉHEL vire son train de pêche, après une croche, et n’est de ce fait plus manoeuvrant, le KRASNODAR conserve son cap.
Le patron du chalutier, ayant tardivement pris conscience du risque de collision, tente cependant une manoeuvre de dernière extrémité, barre à gauche et machine en avant toute, mais le choc, bordé contre bordé, est inévitable. 
Après l’abordage, le patron du navire de pêche entre en liaison radio avec le KRASNODAR. Les deux officiers n’arrivent pas à se comprendre et à converser en anglais. Le KRASNODAR poursuit sa route vers Ouessant et le CAP FRÉHEL, qui a deux blessés légers à bord, fait route vers Saint-Malo, après avoir informé le CROSS Jobourg de l’accident.

The weather was bad with strong winds and heavy seas. The ship was working heavily. The chief mate had given early instruction to the bosun and the deck crew to not enter the deck on foreship for safety reason and to proceed with indoor paint and repair works they had started the day before already.

After breakfast the bosun instructed two ABs to join him for works necessarily to be performed on deck, thus ignoring the safety instructions given by the chief mate ear-lier that same morning. Although the two AB’s were reluctant to follow the bosun and to better obey the chief mate order they finally followed the bosun on deck. As per the boson’s direction the two pilot ladders installed on either side of the vessel’s main deck should be protected and secured for the potential risk of being washed away by overcoming seas
.
After works on starboard side were done the bosun together with the two ABs’ crossed over the free hatch covers toward port side to secure the pilot equipment over there. While one AB remained on the hatch cover the other AB together with the bosun passed through the catwalk ladder down to the main deck. There, the bosun was hit by a strong surging green water sea swell pouring onto the port side main deck. As observed by the two ABs’ who had found shelter on time the body of the bosun – apparently unconscious – was adrift in the wave and was then washed overboard.
Although an effective and full scale MoB manoeuvre was sparked immediately, fol-lowed by SAR actions, the body of the bosun could not be recovered.

The bosun remained the only casualty in this calamity. The two ABs’ could escape without injuries. There was no damage to the ship and no environmental impact on the surrounding sea.
The occurrence was classified to being a very serious marine casualty subject to be fully investigated as per the Casual Code.
The objective was to find out why the bosun violated the written work order to not en-ter the foredeck weather permitted.

The vessel had departed from Molfetta in the early morning hours of 06 October 2010 and sea-going routine was soon dominating.

Around noon time the engine watch crew was faced with an air leakage in the main engine system which caused the chief engineer to report to the master and to ask for a temporary main engine stop to accomplish repairs and to replace with a spare regulator. 

After lunch one of two diesel generators was started and the main engine stopped. Shortly thereafter, the diesel generator failed to function properly and to substitute the shaft generator, which, with the main engine running, had maintained the vessel’s electricity supply.
Various attempts to restart the generator failed and also afford to get the second generator started proceeded unsuccessful. Finally, with all compressed starting air wasted and only the emergency batteries left, the chief engineer had the idea to utilize pressured oxygen from bottles, normally used for welding works, to get a generator restarted.

With orders and instructions received and under supervision of the chief engineer the oiler on duty attempted to arrange a connection mechanism of the oxygen bottle with the generator’s starting air input. 

After a connection was poorly established the oxygen bottle was opened 3 or 4 times until suddenly a violent explosion took place, which severely injured the oiler as well as the chief engineer.
A fire, which broke out next in connection to the explosion, was extinguished with shipboard means rather quick and the two injured crew were recovered with first aid rendered. 

The two seafarers survived the ordeal and were taken by the rapidly approached Italian Coast Guard for hospitalization to port of Manfredonia. The vessel proceeded to Manfredonia as well where she was to be inspected by police and local Authorities as well as by a flag State official.

The accident provoked the flag State to instigate a focused investigation and to prepare a marine safety investigation report.

A wiper’s duty pattern on his watch cycle was to physically control the belt operation between two belt rooms, while the off-loading operation was alternatively monitored by either the second or third mate from the vessel’s cargo control room. 

The watch team was equipped with walkie-talkie for communication purposes to report any operational event worthy to note and to alert to potential risk forthcomings.

Without having triggered any alarm or communicated on a potential risk the wiper was associated with some time during his watch he was found dead by the chief mate during one of his control rounds. The wiper had been caught in the conveyor belt and was crushed to death by the port tunnel conveyor roller. 

The discharging operation was stopped immediately and the vessel management as well as local institutional investigators have started to thoroughly analyse the fatality.
The accident provoked the flag State to instigate a focused inspection on-scene, inclusive a detailed vetting of the vessel’s belt operation system. A marine safety investigation will be conducted with a marine safety investigation report to follow.

Because the cook was counted to be aboard upon departure from the last port of call it was now safe to assume that the cook had been fallen over board.
At this stage the master prompted MoB alarm. A SAR operation was triggered and coordinated by MRCC Lisbon, which put  Navy ships and aircrafts on task. The master turned Arlau on her way, and together with some other ships having all been in close vicinity they all participated in the SAR operation. However, the missing seafarer was not found.

Whilst attending the ballast pump, the fire alarm was activated.  The time was about 2345.  The oiler returned to the engine control room to observe dense smoke inside.  He used a portable CO2 extinguisher although he was unable to see the flames due to the dense smoke.
Following an analysis of the situation, it was concluded that the fire could not be controlled using local means and after following the necessary procedures, the fixed fire fighting installation was activated.

The chief officer, who was operating the starboard hydraulic winch and had switched it to hauling, was caught by the line being wound onto the drum while attempting to clear it at the same time with his right foot. He let go of the spring-loaded operating lever of the winch, which then clicked back to the neutral position properly. Due to the winch’s technically induced stop delay, it did not stop immediately after the operating lever was released, but as subsequent tests concluded, only about 3.5 seconds later because of its design. This time delay resulted in the officer being dragged onto the winch by the line. In the process, he suffered a femoral neck fracture and other non-life threatening injuries.

The route went south in the river Österdalälven and trough the lake Insjön. After passing the railway bridge in Insjön the plan was to continue south for a while before heading back to Leksand.

On board there were 49 passengers and ten crew members. All were members of the non progit organization which  took care and operated the steamship Engelbrekt.

The wheelhouse was manned by a helmsman and the master. The helmsman, who had long experience of Engelbrekt and the lake, was conning the ship. Next to him was the master who made his third trip. Normally, he was operating a taxi boat company in another lake and was working on Englebrekt when needed.

In the western part of Insjön there was a small islet called Getholmen which they had to pass before the railway bridge. The passage could be done either on the north or the south side. Going north of the Getholmen mean that the ship to make a sharp turn south after passing the islet. Close to the turn there was also a fish farm anchored, on the mainland side.

To indicate safe water there were two green spar buoys on the north side of Gethomen. Near the fishfarm there was also red spar buoy. In order to stay safe the south bound ship had to keep the green buoys on the port side and the red one on the starboard side. 

As the ship approached Getholmen the master and the helmsman noticed some orange colored jerricans in the water ahead of them. At first they thought that the jerricans was marking a fish net, something that was a common sight in the autumn. 

They only saw one of the two green spar buoys in the area. After checking the chart, the helmsman and master draw the conclusion that the jerricans was substituting the second green buoy. As the ship passed the jerricans the helmsman therefore put the rudder hard to port in order to turn south.  Shortly after, at approximately 17:00 hours, the ship went aground.

The crew conducted a damage control and arranged for a tug boat to assist. No persons were injured and no damage to the hull or water ingress was noticed.

At 18:31 hours an unknown person called the emergency number to SOS Alarm. The rescue services and police arrived at 19:00 hours. Breathalyzer tests were made on the master and the helmsman. Both test results were negative.

The rescue service assisted in the evacuation of all passengers after which the tugboat pulled the ship off the ground at 21:30 hours. Engelbrekt then steamed back to Leksand were they arrived at 22:15 hours.

At 10:57 hours am, after FLANDRE had rounded one of these islands, the radar echo of Hua.Chi.8, a landing craft type coaster, appeared on her radar display, at less than 2 miles
(about 1,7 mile), 2 points on the starboard side, crossing.
Despite last minute manoeuvres FLANDRE collided with the coaster on her port stern at 11.01 hours am.
The latter capsized immediately and sank soon after with 6 out of the 7 crew members. There was only one survivor.
FLANDRE had a breach in her bulb afore the collision bulkhead under the water line.
There was no pollution.
The pilot sent FLANDRE to anchorage, leaving her at the Chinese MSA disposal.

Pensant qu’il a pêché un débris quelconque, il vire son chalut et décide de déposer le poids parasite en dehors des zones de pêche, sur une épave située plus au Sud.
Alors qu’il est à moins d’un mille de l’épave, la pluie commence à tomber et les deux matelots entreprennent de capeler leurs cirés. C’est à ce moment qu’une pièce de remontée du chalut casse ; le patron n’a que le temps de stopper et de débrayer le moteur, mais le JERICHO chavire brutalement sur tribord. Les matelots tombent à la mer et le patron s’extirpe de la timonerie. Peu après, le JERICHO flotte à l’envers sans que le radeau de survie ne puisse se déclencher. Les trois marins se perdent rapidement de vue après que le patron ait crié aux matelots de s’écarter de la coque.
La balise 406 MHz se déclenche à 22h29, soit environ une heure après le chavirement ; des moyens sont mis en oeuvre par le CROSS Jobourg à partir de 22h47, bien que la position soit incertaine.

The cruises, with a number of intermediate stops, started and ended at Nybrokajen located at the end of Nybroviken, a small bay between Östermalm and Blasieholmen. At every stop the ship went with the bow in towards the jetty and was kept in position by the propulsion.
On 18 August at 16.30 hrs at Nybrokajen the master and the deckhand relieved the regular crew on board Djurgården 4 for dinner break. After a verbal handover the ship departed on the one-hour cruise.
After departure from the jetty at the Vasa museum there were 75 passengers on board and the master set the course back to Nybrokajen, a distance of approximately 0.5 nautical miles. In Nybroviken there were several other passenger ships berthed along the quay sides. As Djurgården 4 was in line with the ships on the northern side of the bay the master put the gear in neutral to slow down. At this time the deck hand was standing at the forward gate. The passengers were getting ready for arrival and many of them were standing on the forward area of the ship.
At a distance of 50-60 meters from the jetty the master put the gear in reverse in order to stop the ship at the berth. He soon realized that there was no response on the manoeuvre and the ship continued towards the jetty. In an attempt to get reverse power, the master put the throttle handle to maximum for a short moment. But, instead of slowing down, the speed increased so he immediately put the handle in neutral again. The distance to the jetty was 30-40 meters when the master grabbed the microphone to the public address system and informed the people on board to hold on. He also initiated a portside turn to avoid hitting the jetty.
At 17:25 hours Djurgården 4 ran into the jetty at Nybrokajen at a speed of approximately 5-7 knots. The deckhand jumped over the forward railing just as the ship hit the jetty. He landed ashore, immediately called the emergency number 112 and then assisted in mooring the ship. On board Djurgården 4 the situation got chaotic when the passengers could not open the forward gate to disembark the ship. The crew members quickly opened the gate and evacuated the passengers.
In total 24 persons were injured of which eleven were taken to hospital for check up. All, except one person with a fractured collarbone, could leave the hospital the same day. The ship sustained damage to the hull and the superstructure.

Le suivi de la navigation est effectué à l'aide d'une carte électronique, sur l'ordinateur de bord.
Lorsque le patron prend le quart à la suite du matelot, après un court repos, le Laisse D’In Dire navigue en eaux saines, un peu au large de la route tracée. Le matelot se rend alors sur le pont pour préparer le matériel de pêche, tandis que le patron vérifie sur l'ordinateur les points où seront calés les filets.
Peu après, le Laisse D’In Dire heurte violemment les roches situés à proximité de l'îlot de La Pierre Percée. Le matelot questionne brièvement le patron qui ne comprend pas ce qui est arrivé. Le navire est échoué et gîte sur tribord, les sabords de décharge ne parviennent pas à évacuer l'eau qui monte rapidement.
Le patron retourne en timonerie pour tenter d'alerter le CROSS Etel. A ce moment le navire chavire sur tribord et la lourde masse des filets bascule par le fond. Le matelot, un moment prisonnier sous la bâche d'abri, parvient à remonter en surface. Il nage jusqu'au rocher le plus proche et se tient prêt à porter secours au patron qu'il ne voit pas et dont il n'obtient pas de réponse, malgré ses appels répétés.
Le matelot sera récupéré peu après par le canot SNSM de Pornichet. Les investigations des plongeurs sont rendues difficiles par l'obscurité et l'obstruction provoquée par les filets. Après le lever du jour, le corps sans vie du patron est retrouvée à 10 mètres de l'épave.

Visibility was considerably less than one nautical mile. The Jula S was on a westerly course towards the roads of Tianjin. The Zenith Winner left Tianjin at 03:15 hrs and steered continuously on a head-on course towards the open sea. In the (radar) view of the ships command of the Jula S, up until about 2.5 minutes before the collision and at a distance of approximately 1 nm between the two ships, everything pointed towards an uncomplicated “green – green” passage with a passing distance of approximately 0.3 nm. However, as confirmed by the AIS recordings of vessel Traffic Service (VTS) Tianjin, the Zenith Winner began to turn to starboard at this point for no apparent reason. At about 05:53 hrs, this sudden and unpredictable change in course was noticed on the bridge of the Jula S, which responded with a hard to starboard coursed change and “full astern” as a last moment action shortly after. However, at this point the distance between the two ships was no longer great enough to avoid the collision. The bulbous bow of the Jula S ploughed into the port side of the Zenith Winner leaving an indentation some 3 metres deep in the areas at which the superstructure and cargo hold meets and caused a massive inrush of water there. The Zenith Winner slowly began to founder about 15 minutes after the collision. All ten crew members abandoned the ship and escaped in a liferaft.

A 22h40 TU, les passagers et véhicules accompagnés ont débarqué et les remorques non-accompagnées sont en cours de déchargement. L'appareillage est prévu à 23h30.
La rampe d'accès à la plate-forme voiture du pont 4 bâbord est bloquée. Le chef mécanicien demande de disposer de la plate-forme élévatrice mobile de personnes

La PEMP est conduite, par le second maître, de son poste de mer à l'arrière tribord du pont 3, au pied de la rampe mobile tribord qui permet l'accès au pont 4. Elle est engagée sur la rampe et stationnée en bas de celle-ci, juste au dessus de la charnière de la bavette (ou flap).
La PEMP ne peut monter par ses propres moyens la rampe en position basse; il est donc décidé de procéder au hissage de la rampe pour diminuer sa pente. Le maître d'équipage est positionné au poste de commande de la rampe au pont 3, dans l'attente de l'autorisation de montée qui lui est donnée par le second maître du poste « homme mort » au pont 4.

Au cours de cette manœuvre, la PEMP recule, saute le décrochement entre la rampe et la bavette et tombe sur le pont 3 en se retournant. Dans ce mouvement, le bras du panier se déplie et projette le conducteur contre la cloison tribord en le blessant grièvement à la tête et au thorax. La PEMP qui, dans sa chute a pris de la vitesse, termine sa course contre cette cloison en écrasant la jambe du maître d'équipage.

He woke up at 03.15 hours because of vibrations in the vessel and went quickly to bridge, as did the chief officer. On the bridge was the bridge team.

The master stopped the engine, he could see shore right ahead, he was slightly confused and began finding out what had happened. He could see that no change of course had been carried out as there should have been.

Prior to this watch the 2nd officer did not sleep as usual, but he had 5 – 6 cans of beer (4,7%). He drank these cans of beer from 1900 – 2200 hours in his cabin celebrating the good news that his military service had been postponed. 

When taking over the watch at 24.00 hours he felt intoxicated. He took over the watch from the 3rd officer, who however stayed on the bridge for approximately ½ hour because of traffic. The 2nd officer sent down the Able seaman to the mess room because the Able seaman had complained of pain in his foot. It was agreed that the 2nd officer would call for the Able seaman if necessary – heavy traffic or the like. He had never navigated in the Baltic Sea before.

The 2nd officer had set out waypoints for the passage and the autopilot was in service. Vessel’s speed was appr. 14 knots. An alarm was set to give a signal at change of course more than 0.3 cable, a constantly beeping sound. The alarm sound was not loud, and he did not hear it.

After appr. 0215 hours, the 2nd officer does not remember any more because he fell asleep in the chair on the bridge. He suddenly woke up at 03.15 hours observing shore right ahead. After the grounding, he called for the master, who was already on his way to the bridge.

The 2nd officer is of the opinion that the grounding was not caused by lack of sleep but by alcohol consumption.

At the grounding some damage occurred to ballast and fuel tanks. No pollution.

At 2119 on 7 July 2010 approximately three hours after departure crew members on the bridge observed smoke rising from the forward part of the ship.
It was soon apparent that there was a rapidly developing fire on deck. The fire alarm was activated and the crew mustered according to the muster plan and started the fire fighting efforts.
After approximately 24 hours of fire fighting by the crew members, support ships and a fire fighting aeroplane, the fire was considered to be under control. From the evening of 9 July 2010, the fire fighting effort was organised by a salvage master and fire fighters from ashore assisted by the ship’s crew.
On 18 July 2010, CHARLOTTE MAERSK sailed under own power to the Port of Tan-jung Pelepas, Malaysia to discharge the cargo. The fire fighters from ashore were de-mobilized on 22 July 2010.
There were only minor damages to the hull and deck and some deformation due to heat on two hatches of cargo hold no. 6. Approximately 160 containers were damaged.
One crew member subsequently suffered respiratory problems from inhaling smoke from the fire.
A certificate of commendation from the IMO was awarded to the crew of Charlotte Maersk for their acts of bravery during the fire in July 2010.

Before arriving at its destination the second officer went on deck to assist in the mooring work, and positioned himself next to a cadet and an able seaman at the winch aft of the forecastle on the starboard side. As the Master manouevered the vessel alongside the platform at the ramps, a sea cadet climbed ashore to receive and make the lines fast. The platform was short and the vessel got a long overhang in the forward, making the spring line quite long. The breast line was led out from the winch, where the second officer was standing. The breast line was led in a tight angle between the winch and the bollards on board, with the roller in the centre. As the line was sent ashore and made fast the second officer was standing at the winch. According to hiim, he heard the Master calling something from the bridge and turned around so his back was facing the railing. He then had the manouevering handle of the winch in front of him and was not sure whether to slack out or heave on the line. He then started to heave on the line by pulling the handle. After securing the spring line, the cadet on the forecastle was about to go aft to assist with the other lines when he heard a cracking sound. He looked towards the place where the second officer was standing, and saw the roller being torn off its fitting. The second officer was hit by the line as it came loose. He fell and instinctively held on to the manouevering handle. This caused the winch to continue heaving and, as a result, his legs were caught in it before he released the handle. The rescue services were alerted and arrived within a few minutes. The mooring rope on the winch was cut off in order to free the second officer. He sustained serious fractures to both legs and lost a lot of blood. His right leg later had to be amputated.

On board were two men, and the vessel was navigating by auto pilot on course 085° at approx. 8 knots. During the passage the best hand rested in the cabin forward while the skipper stayed in the wheel house.   

At some time the skipper observed AFRICAN ZEBRA on the radar at approx. two miles and approx. 40° to port. It seemed to the skipper as AFRICAN ZEBRA was going to pass astern of NINANITU and thus he took no action with regard to that ship. 

Bulk carrier AFRICAN ZEBRA was navigating southward by Route T at course 209° at approx. 13 knots. On duty on the bridge were an officer and an AB as a lookout.

After having his dinner, the master came to the bridge. He saw immediately visually a fishing vessel approx. 1½ cable from the ship on starboard bow obviously at risk of a collision. The duty officer and the lookout had not seen the fishing vessel.

Both ships were manoeuvred in attempt to avoid a collision but NINANITU hit into the staboard side of AFRICAN ZEBRA.

AFRICAN ZEBRA turned around and a lifeboat was launched to relieve the fishermen on NINANITU that was at risk of sinking. But none of the fishermen wanted to board the lifeboat. Via a pilot boat and a Dutch navy ship in the area an alert was raised and a rescue operation was initiated. Both fishermen were rescued by a Swedish rescue helicopter.

At 1330 hrs Pilot disembarked the vessel and, at 1336hrs full away was given on main engines. At 1404hrs in position 38º 53.2´N 118º08.0´E the course was altered to 106º (T) and the vessel was making 11.6 knots on full sea speed.    
On 20 Jun at 0100 hrs, vessel was on a course 098º (T) making a speed of 12.9 knots. The visibility at this time was reduced to about 4-5 nautical miles.
At 0130hrs, on passing the reporting line of entrance to Laotie Shan traffic lane, the vessel reported her movement to port Dalian VTS (China) and altered her course to 126º (T). She then entered the traffic lane, continuing on full sea speed. The visibility by this time was reduced to 50-100 meters due to fog.
The Bridge was manned by OOW (Second Officer) and a helm’s man. Boson and an Ordinary Seaman were posted on forecastle deck, to keep lookout when visibility reduced. The vessel was taken on hand steering by helm’s man.  The weather was good with light breeze from East at 4-6 knots                                                                                                                                            
At 0140hrs a vessel’s echo was observed on radar by the 2nd officer on watch - 60-70º on the starboard bow at a distance of 7 cables.     
On AIS the vessel was identified as M.V. Hai Jung. On identifying the vessel efforts were made by the 2nd officer on watch to call her on VHF but there was no response.
At this time another vessel crossed the stern from port quarter to starboard quarter at a distance of 8 cables and OOW attended to it. Once passed clear it was observed that Hai Jung approached further close and CPA was seen as Zero on Radar. 
By the time the OOW could assess the situation and take avoidance action, it was too late and collision was inevitable.
There were no maneuvering signals or fog signals displayed by the other vessel whilst attempting to cross the traffic lane from starboard to port and the vessel continued on her course with same speed. 
At 0145 MV Jing Feng altered her course to starboard by giving 10 º helms and later by giving hard over helm to starboard. At 0147 hrs the vessel collided with MV Hai Jung in traffic lane in position 38º 31.3´N 120º 57.01´E.  There was no response or action taken by Hai Jung to avoid collision.

The vessels collided in dense fog weather conditions and, therefore, MV Hai Jung could not be seen by any ship’s crew or the OOW either before or after the collision. The point of contact was not known to any one. It was established that after collision she broke and foundered immediately, as observed by Boson, keeping lookout on forecastle deck. 
At 0148 hrs the Master reached Bridge and put the main engine on emergency stop, notified engine room to change over to maneuvering speed. Crew was sent to check the status of damages suffered by the ship. 
The incident was immediately reported to VTS Dalian and they were requested for assistance in search and rescue operations for the crew of Cambodian registered M.V. Hai Jung which had foundered.
At 0155hrs MV Jing Feng commenced Search and Rescue operations. By 0327 hrs the crew of Jing Feng was able to pick up three crew members (two alive and one crew member dead) and took them on board. 
Master reported that the forepeak tank had flooded up to 8.7 meters and stabilized at that level. 
At 0340 hrs rescue boat of MSA Dalian reached the spot of casualty and managed to recover 4 bodies and transferred the corpse on MV Jing Feng by 0530 hrs.
At 0710 the vessel proceeded to port Dalian as required by Dalian port authorities for further investigations. Master and OOW were arranged to go to Dalian by air to assist in investigation.
On 20 June by 1430 vessel was made all fast to berth at port Dalian for repairs and investigation.

Slightly delayed, around 17.00 on 16 June, they arrived at the restaurant Strandbryggan, close to the bridge to Djurgârden, where they were supposed to embark the boats.
At the place of embarkation there was a general murmur of people speaking and music playing in the background which made it difficult, if not impossible, to hear the safety briefing for those in the group standing in the rear; one of them was the passenger who was later injured.
Two or three laminated safety notes were handed over to the group for reading during the safety briefing and the later injured passenger had just a glance at it.
After the short briefing, conducted by one of the captains of the four chartered RIBs, the passengers went to the boats and shortly after they departed. The boat that the later injured passenger was sitting in could take six passengers but on this trip there were only five. Two were seated in front of the captain and three were seated behind.
The first 15 minutes they proceeded quite slowly, according to the passenger, until they had caught a passenger ferry up trading between Finland and Sweden. At that point the captain shouted a question, asking if the passengers were ready, increased the speed and jumped in the waves for about 15 minutes. After that he overtook the ferry and turned around to meet the waves.
According to the passenger it felt like a ""washboard of waves"". After the boat had passed what he thought was the last wave, he sat down but yet another wave came and lifted the boat and the seat hits him from below. He heard a crashing sound in his back, he felt an enormous pain and shouted to the captain to slow down, which the captain did. During the passage to a close by jetty the injured passenger shouted to the captain to slow down due to increasing pain when passing the waves. The passenger's colleague has afterwards told him that he also repeatedly tried to make the captain slow down.
When arriving at the jetty the captain asked him how he was doing and he replied that he was in pain. The other passengers helped him up on the jetty and there he immediately lay down.
Sid 1
After a few minutes he sat up with his hands holding his back and when the captain saw this, he manoeuvred away and continued the trip with the other passengers.

The captain has another view of what happened. After departure and when passing Blockhusudden he increased the speed to about 30 knots on average. He overtook a ferry on its starboard side and suddenly the passenger in front of him shouted and he immediately reduced the speed in order to find out what was wrong. The speed at the time of the accident was 15 to 20 knots according to the captain.
He observed that the passenger was in pain and he manoeuvred the boat back to a close by jetty in order for the passenger to get off the boat. When the passenger was ashore, sitting on a bench, he told the captain that he thought he had strained the muscles in his back.
After consultation with both the injured passenger and his colleague he decided to continue the trip with the other passengers.
The injured passenger suffered compression fracture of number X, XI and XII vertebras.

with 27 passengers and 11 crew members on board. The destination was Stockholm via
Gota kanal
Gota kanal stretches from Sjòtorp at lake Vânern to Mem in the Baltic Sea and is
managed by Gota kanal AB (Kanalbolaget). West of Sôderkôping, the channel passes an
area called Klevbrinken where a guest harbor, a camping site and a place for winter
docking of boats are located on the north bank. After the harbor, towards Sôderkôping, at
an old bridge abutment on the north side the channel, the width temporarily decreases from
approximately 25 to 14 meters. This area is known to cause a bank effect for the vessels
passing. Bank effect can be described as unequal latéral forces on a ship in narrow areas.
The old bridge abutment was not part of the guest harbor and it was according to
régulations prohibited for boats to moor there. Kanalbolaget allowed boats to be moored
in the harbor 14 days free of charge in conjunction with launching or docking.
The sailing boat Bolero was launched in Klevbrinken after winter Storage on the 19th May
2010. It was moored at the old bridge abutment since there was no space in the harbor.
On the 29t h at approximately 07.20 pm, Juno left the lower locks of Duvkullen and
continued towards Sôderkôping. The Chief Offîcer was conning the ship, an Able seaman
was lookout and the Master had just come up to the wheelhouse. The crew on board Juno
noticed that the harbor was full of boats and that a sailing boat was moored at the bridge
abutment. The Chief Offîcer and the Master discussed the situation and realized that it
would be a tight passage but decided to do it anyway as there were no other alternatives.
If they stopped there was a risk that Juno would have drifted across the channel and
collided with the boats moored in the guest harbor.
The Chief Offîcer slowed down and kept more south in the channel. Just before the
abutment the bank effect caused Juno to turn to port towards the sailing boat. The Chief
Offîcer put the rudder hard to starboard and gave a kick on the engine in an attempt to
stop the turn. When he realized that a collision could not be avoided, he put the engine
control handles to full astern to stop the ship. At 07.30 pm Juno collided with the Bolero
which suffered extensive damage to its hull and took in water. There were no persons on
board the Bolero at the time of the collision. On board Juno the roof above the portside
bridge wing was slightly damaged when it was hit by the mast of the sailing boat.","","","","","","","11","27","","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","2010-10-15",""

Following the finalisation of all formalities, the vessel set sail with a cargo of grain to the discharge port of Beirut.

The voyage was uneventful until 24 May 2010.  After clearing the Dardanelles passage, the master handed over the watch to the second mate at 2400.  After several checks, the master retired to his cabin at about 0130.  Both main engines were running smooth.  Visibility was good with calm seas.  The vessel had the port side radar running, whilst the GPS was giving a speed of approximately 7.5 knots.  About 30 minutes prior to the grounding, the second mate altered course from a southerly heading.
At this point, the full disk capacity alarm on the INMARSAT-C unit was activated.  The second mate investigated the alarm and subsequently started to check and clean the messages from the disk.  Whilst investigating the matter, he noticed that the vessel was very close to a small island.  At about 0328, he called the master to inform him of the situation.  However, before making to the bridge, the master felt the ship vibrate and heard the noise of metal against te seabed.  The vessel had ran aground at a speed of about seven knots, near Lesvos Island, Greece in position 390 19’N  260 26.6’E.

Although the propulsion system did not sustain any damages, the vessel sustained deformation and cracks on part of her bottom shell plating.

Late that night a valve on one of the CO2 pilot cylinders developed a leak and charged the system ready for release. A second leak in the main control valve then caused the entire system to activate resulting in an uncontrolled release of CO2 gas into the engine room.

An automatic alarm in the engine room had warned the duty engineer there of the impending release so he had left the engine room to investigate the reason for the alarm.

The ship was flying the flag of Germany. The ship had elevated herself from the water independently by lowering four legs and in so doing had become a working platform connected with the seabed (so-called self elevating unit). Using the heavy crane, an iron pipe (so-called “pile”) of 85 metres in length weighing 425 tonnes and with a diameter of about 3.5 metres was to be lowered into the water in a vertical position, where together with two other pipes of the same dimension and with about half of it driven into the seabed, it was to be used as the foundation of a wind turbine. In executing this task, the upper end of pipe, which was lying alongside, was grasped by the heavy crane by means of a hydraulic grab and raised on one side. At an elevation angle of about 35 degrees and a height of about 40 metres, the pipe suddenly slipped out of the grab and fell with great force back onto the deck of the ship. Three people on deck were slightly injured while trying to move to safety and/or falling due to vibration.  The superstructure sustained heavy material damage. The pile’s direction of fall and the fact that at midday there were only a few people on deck prevented the consequences from being more severe.","Wind turbine installation vessel","","7650","Germanischer Lloyd (GL)","2623","","12","","","","","","","","","2011-08-03",""

The safety cutouts of the boiler were started and stopped approximately 12-5 times without any abnormalties. At this point, in accordance with the Chief Engineer's explanation, while running in automatic mode, all relevant safety valves and safety alarms and devices were tested and found ok.

Afterwards, the boiler was turned into manual mode (as used in emergency situations) by the operator with a key switch on the operational panel. Then the boiler was pre purged before being lit to carry out one more test. The intention of the surveyor was to check one (1) remaining item, ie Low level alarm in the boiler drum and due to this cut off fuel to the burner. Unfortuantely, it appeared that the pre purging was insufficient and there was a flash back situation when the crew started the manual operation ignition procedure. It was during these tests, that the boiler back fired resulting in an explosion in the combustion chamber. All three (3) crew members and attending Surveyor sustained severe burns and were transported into specialist hospital Boberg.

When the chief officer entered a cargo hold that was full of logs that had been loaded at a previous port, he rapidly lost useful consciousness (lost the ability to hold on to the ladder) and fell from the ladder onto the cargo below. 
The ship's bosun had accompanied the chief officer to the cargo hold access and when the chief officer fell he alerted nearby deck crew before leaving to collect rescue equipment. One of the nearby crew members went to the hold access and on seeing the unconscious chief officer below, entered the hold with the intention of rescuing him. He too rapidly lost useful consciousness and fell from the ladder onto the cargo below. 
The 2 crew members lost useful consciousness owing to the combined effects of an oxygen-depleted atmosphere and the likely presence of toxic gases, both consequences of the organic decomposition of the logs in the closed cargo hold. The oxygen levels in the cargo hold were as low as 1% to 3%, which would cause loss of effective consciousness within 3 to 9 seconds, and total unconsciousness very soon afterwards, followed by death within 5 minutes. Both crew members were pronounced dead at the scene after they had been rescued from the hold access. 
The dangers of the organic decomposition of logs and other organic cargos in enclosed spaces are well known in the international maritime community, and were documented on board the TPC Wellington, but in spite of this the high risk this posed to the crew had not been identified, no specific training had been given to the crew members to heighten their awareness of the risk, and no emergency drills had been conducted in recent times for rescue from enclosed spaces. 
The emergency response by the ship's crew to the accident was not well co-ordinated, which reduced the possibility of saving the lives of the 2 men in the cargo hold. 
Internationally a disproportionately high number of deaths attributable to entry into enclosed spaces has prompted a review by the International Maritime Organisation of what can be done to improve safety in this area. The Commission has not been able to make any new and meaningful recommendations to address this well known safety issue. The Commission will, however forward this report to the IMO and invite the appropriate committee to note the contents of the report for any future programmes to improve awareness of the dangers associated with entry into enclosed spaces.

He was quickly recovered from the water by the vessel’s sea boat and transferred to a coastguard helicopter which flew him to hospital. Sadly, the cadet died as a result of the severe injuries he had sustained. This was the first fatality on board TS Royalist in her 39 years of service. The sea cadet fell to the deck because he unclipped his belt harness from the wire jackstay provided on the fore course yard, contrary to his training and onboard procedures for work at that position.

An AB awoke in his cabin on upper deck of Arosia at about 22:00 hours, when he smelled and then sighted light smoke followed by darker smoke in his cabin coming through the side bulkhead. He investigated by opening the adjacent cabin door and observed the cabin ceiling, in way of the florescent light area, on fire. He immediately closed the door and started shouting “Fire”, ran up to the poop deck and activated the fire alarm.

The bosun, who appeared on-scene first, joined the AB and both triggered action trying to put out the fire. As the fire intensified, the bosun ordered the meanwhile congregated crew to open the accommodation doors on upper deck and poop deck as the smoke was getting thicker and breathing was become difficult for them. The crew proceeded outside rigged hoses and started to fight the fire and cooling the boundary.

Without having the ship’s crew correctly mustered at initial stage when the fire alarm was first triggered, all present crew was engaged in fire fighting activities with only little control and leadership at the beginning. During the process it was realized that two o the ships staff were missing and a search was prompted. Confusion was increased when some of the staff reported to having seen the two missing crew only recently.

Only after several unsuccessful attempts searching for the missing crew, ship staff donned breathing apparatuses and fireman outfits to enter the cabins of the missing persons.

At 22:45 hrs and 23:10 hrs a missing engine fitter and a deck fitter were found unconscious on their cabin floors. The two casualties were placed on the boat deck where the ship staff attempted to revive them, including several times with cardiopulmonary resuscitation. However, all efforts made were unsuccessful. Both seafarers died on-scene.

The fire spread from the upper deck to the poop deck and then to the boat deck before finally being extinguished. All other crew remained unharmed.

Ever Excel was alongside in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, China undergoing a preliminary environmental compliance inspection, which required that the pit of the lift shaft be checked for oil residues. The second engineer was unable to open the lift shaft doors to gain access to the lift pit and the chief engineer intervened to resolve the problem. Without stating his intentions, the chief engineer entered the lift car, climbed through an escape hatch to reach the top of the lift car, and closed the hatch behind him. 

The second engineer reset the lift controls, incorrectly assuming that the chief engineer had taken manual control of the lift from on top of the lift car. The chief engineer had not, and the lift was returned to its normal automatic operating mode. The lift moved upwards at its usual operating speed and trapped the chief engineer against the door still of the deck above, asphyxiating him. It is not known exactly what the chief engineer intended to do, but it is likely that he was looking at the back of the lift shaft doors to establish how the licking mechanism worked.

The stop signal did not apply to her as she was classified to Traffic Group 3. Therefore, she maintained a constant speed and prepared to overtake the Endeavor: The pilot of the two ships discussed this manoeuvre.

When the forecastle of Cranz was on a level with the aft superstructure of the Endeavor, the bow of the Cranz was drawn toward the Endeavor due to hydrodynamic effects. This turning movement led to a collision between the two ships, which pushed the Endeavor further forward, causing the Cranz to separate from her again. It was not possible to bring the turning movement of the Cranz under control and the momentum caused the ship to move towards the southern embankment of the NOK with such force that it was only possible to refloat her with tug assistance.

At 17:05 LT on the 31st of March 2010 the ship unmoored its last line and proceeded to recover its starboard side anchor. Weather conditions included strong easterly winds of 40 km/hr. No pilot or tug services were requested by the Captain. 
The winds pushed the vessel against the pier making her hit the dock twice on her port side while she was manoeuvring astern to clear the pier ‘Fords I’. Once the ship cleared said pier, the captain initiated a 225° turn left to position the vessel towards the outbound channel using the two engines and the bow thrusters. This manoeuvre in a confined area of about 320 m in length was challenging, as the strong winds kept pushing the vessel against the ferry terminal. The Captain managed to turn the vessel, but hit the outer corner of the ferry terminal in the process. The vessel finally grounded on top of the buoy QP9 at the beginning of the outbound channel. The vessel sustained damages to its bottom plates, rudder and starboard side propeller. No cracks to the bottom plates were found and no pollution was caused. The vessel was refloated in the evening of March 31st, 2010 and brought back to the pier. The investigation concluded that the grounding was caused by human error. It was the first time the Captain manoeuvred the ship and he disregarded the strong easterly winds and decided against requesting pilot and tug services

First aid was immediately rendered by his near-by working shipmates on deck, followed by ongoing reanimation attempts by the alerted 2nd officer, combined with medical advice the master had meanwhile gained from TMAS Medico Cuxhaven/Germany.
All attempts to reanimate the AB with shipboard means failed and further outside medical help could not be rendered on time. The vessel changed course towards Durban, having been the closest port to reach. However, the seafarer died prior arriving. The accident occurred during fair weather conditions while the vessel was utilizing the Agulhas Current some 200 miles south of Durban on her way from Cape Town to Singapore. The green water penetrated trough the anchor hawse pipes when the vessel was forced to heavily pitch after being hit by a couple of high swell waves in an otherwise almost calm sea.
At 10:20 hours LT, not even an hour after the accident had happened, the master started to call MAYDAY, asking for medical assistance from a nearby vessel with a doctor probably on board. All calls were in vain. None of his calls were even responded.

The vessel had been fishing 3 - 4 days and was underway when the accident occured. 

There were no fishing gear in the water. The wind was about 15 - 16 sek.meter from SW. There was som swell and heavy rain. The speed was 4 to 5 knot heading against the waves so the waves and wind was hitting port bow. No waves came over the bow or went over the shipside. Everything was normal until about 23:00 hours. Suddently the navigator and look out on the bridge heard a bang from the bow area. Shortly after the shipp started to act more heavily in water and started to list to starboard. Shortly after the waterpumps on the workdeck under maindeck started. Only minutes after that several alarms started on the bridge. The navigator tried to change heading all in an attempt to work against the listing bur with no success. He then raised the alarm and sent the look out to call out one crew member still sleeping. When this crewmember shortly after headed up to the bridge, he observed through a window from the corridor and into the work deck that there were water at about one meter hight on the deck following the listing of the ship.
When all 3 crewmembers was standing on the bridge, it was decided to abandon the ship due to the klisting being so bad that water was entering hatches and doors. Shortly after the ship sunk. The crew saved their lives just about. All events happend within a very short time.

An ROV Inspection some months later revealed no damaged to the part of the ship that was visible above the seabed. Unfortunately the ship hull from the load line and down was covered by the seabed.
The ship was 7 years old and in very good condition. Based on the ROV examination, available drawings and inspection report and the witness statements from the crew, the most likely cause was that the ship hit an object floating in the sea, the hull damaged and water went into storage rooms below load lines. Open hatches from storage room to the work deck,  made it possible for the water to fill several rooms and eventually leading to the loss of the ship.

She was sailing at a speed of 3 knots and was making good a westerly course. The AB on watch on the bridge had just taken over from the skipper, who went to his cabin. In the crew’s quarters the chief engineer and the ABs were resting. At the same time, the chemical tanker vessel MANAS, flying Malta flag, was making good a 075° course at an average speed of 14 knots in the north-eastbound traffic lane of the strait of Dover. She was at 9 nautical miles in the West of SAINT JACQUES II. The second officer had taken over the 4 hour watch at 0.40 am.
At 1.31 am, both vessels were at 46 miles in the bearing 254° from Mont Saint-Frieux when they collided; at first MANAS bulb knocked in SAINT JACQUES II port stern under works, then got under the port warp which broke very quickly; at the same time MANAS anchor and the upper part of her port forecastle got in contact with SAINT JACQUES II port superstructures and damaged them severely. Then both vessels parted and SAINT JACQUES II stabilized. Once apart both vessels slowed down, stopped and stayed in the area.
SAINT JACQUES II skipper informed Gris-Nez MRCC that his vessel was seriously damaged, however no significant leak was reported. The AB on watch on-board the trawler had been wounded. MANAS captain confirmed to Gris Nez MRCC that his vessel collided with SAINT JACQUES II and proposed to assist her. After having investigated the damages, SAINT JACQUES II skipper decided to sail toward Boulogne-sur-Mer, her home port escorted by the Maritime administration patrol boat THEMIS. The convoy got alongside at 10.45 am. MANAS that suffered only minor material damages resumed her course at 2.26 am, in agreement with Gris-Nez MRCC.

Just before midnight a high pressure alarm sounded from tank no. 2 port. The OOW shifted over the loading to tanks no. 3 starboard and port. He reset the alarm and ordered the AB to check the P/V valve. The AB saw fumes coming out of the valve which made the OOW think that it was OK to commence loading. The pressure in no. 2 port tank was normal when the loading of the tank started after the first alarm.
After a while there was a second high pressure alarm from tank no. 2 port. Also at this time the AB saw fumes coming out of the P/V valve. The OOW then assumed that the sensor did not work properly.
At 00.35 just a few minutes after the second alarm there was an explosion in no. 2 port tank.
At the shipyard one discovered an ice plug in the ventilation pipe. The ice plug did not choke up the pipe completely so it was obvious that some fumes passed the ice and could be seen by the AB when he checked the P/V valve.

Les conditions météorologiques sur zone sont mauvaises. Le vent d’ENE est d’environ 25/30 noeuds, la mer est agitée.
Le 11 février, comme tous les jours, il est prévu 5 traits de chalut. En raison d’une pêche relativement médiocre, alors que le navire se trouve à 48 milles dans le 290° de Ouessant, le patron décide de changer de secteur de pêche.
Les chaluts sont à poste sur les enrouleurs, ne restent que les panneaux, en pendant à l’extérieur des hiloires de pavois, à positionner et à saisir. Pour cette opération, le Bara’Mann est en avant lente. Les captures du dernier trait de chalut sont dans les parcs prévus à cet effet
sur le pont arrière, en attente d’être traitées.
Deux marins sont affairés au panneau tribord et deux autres à celui de bâbord.
L’opération nécessite de passer un câble dans le réa d’une poulie située en avant de la chape
du débordeur (boucle d’oreille). Cette manœuvre est rendue d’autant plus délicate que le navire roule dans ces conditions de mer difficiles.
Le matelot chargé du panneau tribord grimpe sur une serre de renfort entre deux jambettes de pavois au-dessus du sabord de décharge et sur le panneau afin de passer le câble par la poulie. Durant cette opération, alors qu’aucun membre d’équipage ne porte de VFI, il chute à la mer. Alerté par l’équipage, le patron engage une manœuvre afin de tenter de récupérer le matelot à la mer. Un des marins se jette à l’eau pour le secourir. Les tentatives de récupération des deux hommes à la mer ne permettent pas de les ramener à bord. Epuisés par leurs efforts et pris par le froid, les deux marins partent à la dérive.
D’important moyens maritimes et aériens sont mis en œuvre, coordonnés par le CROSS Corsen. Les recherches cessent le 12 février 2010 en fin de matinée. Les deux hommes ne seront pas retrouvés.

On the same day, at approximately 03.50 hours, the M/V ALGOMA DISCOVERY
experienced a loss of propulsion. At approximately 03.55 hours, the starboard anchor was
dropped. This corrective action did not sufficiently stop the vessel and at approximately

Lawrence Channel, in the vicinity of Saint-Laurent-de-l’Ile-d’Orleans. Shortly after the
grounding occurred, sounding of ballast tank and cargo hold bilges were taken and no
water ingress was noted. The grounding caused no pollution.

On the bridge at that time were the Master, the Officer of the Watch (OOW), the

required for a vessel the size of the M/V ALGOMA DISCOVERY and for the intended

forward shoulder and the second to centre lead aft. The stability, longitudinal shear and
bending moment and stress were calculated and approved by the Class ABS Consulting

The vessel was on passage from Port Askaig to Kennacraig, with 14 passengers and 24 crew on board. There were no injuries but both the vessel and the linkspan were damaged. 
The accident occurred after control of the starboard propeller pitch was lost due to a mechanical failure. Consequently, the starboard propeller remained at full ahead as the ferry made her approach to the berth. Although the port propeller was put to full astern, the starboard anchor was let go, and the starboard engine was shut down, this did not prevent Isle of Arran from landing heavily on the linkspan. 
Factors leading to the mechanical failure included the fitting of a manufacturer’s original spare component which was incorrect, a lack of technical information leading to incorrect adjustment, inadequate testing of the pitch control system, and the lack of a robust technical investigation following a previous failure.  There was no test of the pitch control system before Isle of Arran was committed to the final approach into Kennacraig.  As a consequence, the high speed of approach to the berth and the inability of the ship’s crew to quickly identify the cause of the loss of pitch control, made the resultant heavy contact with the linkspan inevitable.

She was sailing on an easterly navigational course across the Atlantic on Jan. 10, 2010 when she encountered very bad weather. The low pressure system produced westerly winds of more than 40 knots and SW waves of more than 30 feet. The impact of waves over the poop deck combined with the movement of the ship eventually freed two cylinder liners stowed and secured on the poop deck.
 
While attempting to secure the loose liners, six seafarers were injured by the effect of the waves over the main deck. One of the seafarers lost consciousness in the incident and a decision to evacuate him was later made by the ship master. The vessel was about 460 miles off Newfoundland, Canada. The water that sprayed over the poop deck also made its way to the emergency generator room through the exhaust pipe of the emergency generator motor. The sudden activation of the emergency generator produced a short circuit in the emergency switch board.
In order to reach the location agreed upon with the Canadian SAR authorities for the evacuation of the injured crewmember, at 18:00LT of Jan.10, 2010, the vessel changed its course to head W, leading the vessel to receive the effect of the wind and the waves to be felt in the forecastle. The bos’n store was badly damaged accumulating approximately 1.5m of water. On Jan. 13 the injured crewmember was airlifted to Newfoundland, Canada. The vessel continued on her way to reach the port of refuge (Port Hawkesbury, NS, Canada) on Jan. 16, 2010.

A diver survey was conducted on 03.01.2010 by the company Tuukritööde OÜ under surveillance of the representatives of Estonian Maritime Administration and the classification society ABS. The diver survey revealed the ballast tanks afore fractured and holed transversally. In addition, port side ballast tanks No 2, 3 and 4 were also examined inside in order to prove the existence of damages which had been discovered  during the diver survey. Periodical soundings of tanks revealed holes and a leak in the lower forepeak tank. The same applied to the port side ballast tank No 1 where the leakage was about 10 cm per hour.
