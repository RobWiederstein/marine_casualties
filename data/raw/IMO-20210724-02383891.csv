Late on the 10th January, as a result of storm weather conditions, the ship took a starboard list of some 20 degrees with ingress of water into the starboard side ballast tanks.
Early on the 11th January, as result of the heavy list and the prevailing conditions, the ship suffered a total blackout which resulted in a loss of propulsion. A deck stowed container was lost overboard and subsequently three other deck stowed containers were also lost.

By noon on the 11 January the ship, in mid-North Atlantic without any power, was listing 30-35° to starboard. The Master sent out a distress call at 12:10 hours and as a result contact was made with BT Nestor, a tanker which was some 3 hours steaming time away from Irving Forest.
The crew decided to abandon the ship but during the preparations, the crew member's wife, the Chief Officer and a GP seaman were washed overboard. All three were later rescued by aircraft.

The remaining members of the crew subsequently left the ship by jumping overboard while hooked onto the ship's liferaft painter, the liferaft having been successfully launched into the sea.
All Irving Forest's crew, including the crew member's wife, were embarked aboard BT Nestor by 19:00 hours local time.

There was no loss of life as a result of this incident, but Irving Forest subsequently sank.
