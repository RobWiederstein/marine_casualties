It was established that the seat of the fire was in one of the cubicles of the 6.6 kilovolt switchboard, which distributed power from the gas turbine generator to the propulsion motors and auxiliary electrical systems. 

Initial attempts to fight the fire with extinguishers proved to be ineffective and a decision was made to utilise the fixed fire fighting medium and flood the space with CO2. 

This was effective in extinguishing the fire. With the high voltage switchboard out of commission, the ship was towed to Sydney, where it remained for three months undergoing repairs.

The Master was manoeuvring the ship, maintaining position, from the after end of the bridge, looking out over the cargo deck. 
Seas were breaking over the stern, but conditions were not such as to cause the cancellation of cargo operations. 
While a skip was being hoisted to the platform the two-man deck watch aboard Shelf Supporter decided to re-spool a wire used to secure the cargo, onto the winch. While this wire was being released from a block, a sea broke over the stern. Despite a warning from the Master, one of the two men on deck was crushed between the ships's own rubbish skip and an empty skip when it was moved by the seawater.

A licensed Reef Pilot was in charge of the navigation. 
At about 21:00 hours, the ship passed between Alert Patches and OG Rock at the eastern end of the Prince of Wales Channel, Torres Strait, and settled on a course of about 270. The ship's speed over the previous hour had been 12 knots. 
At about 21:11 hours, the ship was abeam of Ince Point and the Pilot saw that the Global Positioning System display showed a speed of 10.5 knots. About three minutes later the Pilot, who had moved to the port bridge wing, heard an alarm or some alerting device ringing on the bridge and he went to investigate. As he got close to the centre line he glanced at the helm indicator and engine room tachometer. The helm indicator showed that full starboard rudder had been applied and the tachometer showed zero revolutions. The ship's head had been paying off to port and the rate of turn increased rapidly as the ship closed with Wednesday Island to the western side of Ince Point. 
The ship's speed had slowed to about 6.5 knots when the engine was restarted. The Pilot had to make a quick decision and decided to maintain full starboard rudder and ordered emergency full ahead revolutions to maximise the rate of turn to starboard. The ship reached a heading of 172, before starting to turn to starboard. At about 21:20 hours, Dakshineshwar grounded in position 10 30.4° South 142 17.9° East, with Ince Point Light bearing 100 x 0.85 of a mile.

The vessel sailed form Hallstavik on 30 September at 14:30 hours bound for Hartlepool, England. At 03:30 hours on 1 October, a smoke alarm was received from the main deck hold. the ship was then approximately 20 nautical miles north of Gotland. 
When the crew had assembled on the bridge, the ship's carbon-dioxide plant on the main deck was activated. The Stockholm Radio Marine Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC) was alerted. Later on, the Tingstäde Radio Marine Rescue Subcentre (MRSC) took over.  

Equipped with breathing apparatus, members of the crew then inspected the hold and discovered that part of the fibreboard consignment was smouldering. The ship then anchored in Kappelshamnsviken off the island of Gotland.

Smoke divers from the Gotland Rescue Services were put on board by helicopter while the ship lay in Kappelshamnsviken. It was then moved to the quay at Storugns.

When additional carbon dioxide had been supplied, fire-fighting was started on 3 October using smoke divers. That evening, an accident occurred in which a smoke diver returning from his shifts lost contact with his colleague, fell over on the main deck and remained lying there with his breathing mask twisted out of its correct position.  He subsequently died in Visby Hospital. On 6 October the fire was deemed to be extinguished.

This operation involved the use of a 64 mm diameter working wire, or ""chaser wire"", which is used to haul the anchors out to the correct position and then to lower the anchors to the seabed. 
As a dedicated chaser wire had not been provided, the ship had been using the starboard, 70 mm towing wire. When this towing wire parted, early that morning, a composite chaser wire, made up from a number of wire pendants shackled together, was used. 
In the early part of the afternoon, one of the anchors failed to set in the seabed and had to be lifted and repositioned. As Maersk Runner started to lift this anchor, the composite chaser wire parted at a spelter socket, positioned just off the winch. The Mate was struck and thrown by flaying wire, suffering severe head and pelvic wounds, as a result of which he died.

The Maersk Navigator was steering a course of 088°T and making good a speed of 11 knots. As the ship was on autopilot, the seaman designated as helmsman was acting as lookout.

At 18:00 hours UTC the second officer of Maersk Navigator detected 3 ships on the ARPA ali moving in the opposite direction. One ships which was later identified as the Sanko Honour was 2° to 3° on the starboard bow. The closest point of approach (CPA) of Sanko Honour was 0.5 mile. The Sanko Honour was sighted visually at a distance of 6.7 miles, fine on the
starboard bow. The second officer of Maersk Navigator altered course to increase the CPA to 0.9 mile. After the altération the Sanko Honour was sighted about 10° on the port
bow. At a range of about 4 miles, the Sanko Honour disappeared visually and from the radar due to heavy rain  squali. After re-adjusting the anti-rain clutter on the ARPA, Sanko Honour reappeared on the radar screen and was tracked again. Radar information indicated that Sanko Honor had altered course to port. Immediately, the second officer of Maersk Navigator put the helm on hard-to-starboard and steadied on a heading of 14 8°T. He then saw the Sanko Honour approaching from the port beam showing a green sidelight and ordered the helm hard-to-starboard and called the master. A short while later, the bow of the Sanko Honour collided with the port side of the Maersk Navigator.


On 20 Jan 1993 at 16:45 hours UTC, the second officer of Sanko Honour took over the watch from the third officer. One of the two 3 cm radars was in use and the ARPA was not in operation. The Sanko Honour was steering 268°T and making good a speed of 16.5 knots. There were two ships forward of her beam. Both ships were moving in the same direction with one ship on either side of her. The ship was on autopilot and the seaman on duty acted
as lookout. There was also a cadet keeping watch with the second officer. At 18:20 hours UTC the second officer of Sanko Honour detected one vessel on the radar screen at a range of
20 miles in the direction of 8° on the starboard bow. This ship was later identified as the Maersk Navigator. The second officer of Sanko Honour began systematic radar plot using the radar reflector plotter. At 18:35 hours UTC, the Maersk Navigator was at a range of 13 miles and 12° on the starboard bow. About this time, the second officer and the cadet sighted the two masthead lights and the green sidelight of Maersk Navigator, about 5° on the starboard bow. At the same time they sighted the port side ship showing the green sidelight and the second officer concluded that the overtaken ship had now became a crossing ship. He changed from automatic steering to manual and altered course to port. The cadet was at the wheel. After this, the Sanko Honour was caught in heavy rain squall and both targets disappeared from the radar screen. An attempt was made to recover both targets by adjusting the anti-rain clutter control and switching on the standby radar but was  nsuccessful. A visual check was made with the aid of binoculars but no ship was seen. At 18:43 hours UTC course was altered 10°to port to give more clearance to the ship being overtaken. Once on this heading, the ship was changed to automatic steering and the cadet was told to keep a lookout for the Maersk Navigator. The cadet saw the red sidelight of Maersk Navigator very close. At the same time the second officer also sighted the Maersk Navigator. Immediately he instructed the cadet to put the wheel on hard-to-port. As the ship was turning to port the Sanko Honour collided with the Maersk Navigator.
