Titan was unmanned. 
The tow progressed slowly northwards off the eastern Australian coast line. Throughout 23,24 and 25 December, the tow experienced strong head winds and sea from the north or north-east, and a strong counter current. 
By 22:00 hours on 25 December, the tow was making good a speed over the ground of about 1 knot, into a head wind of about 26 knots. At about 22:50 hours, those on Rapuhia felt a pronounced jerk and a seaman reported the towing line had parted. No trace could be seen of Titan's riding lights, nor could the barge be seen silhouetted against the sky. Rapuhia was immediately slowed and turned to relocate the tow. A target was seen on the radar and a subsequent sweep by Rapuhia's searchlight showed the barge, floating bottom up. A general call was put out to shipping and the capsize reported to the Australian Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre, Canberra. The ship's principal in Singapore was also told. On 27 December, divers and people acting on behalf of the owner boarded Rapuhia to assess the damage. The emergency towing bridle was secured to Rapuhia. 
It was found that the crane assembly, including the jib and crane tower had fallen off the central lattice work mast. The central mast was bent towards Titan's bow and the slew ring, upon which the crane rotated, was resting at an angle against the central mast. 
The upturned barge was towed to a position off Camden Head, out of the strong south-going current to allow work to be undertaken on the upturned hull. 
After assessing the situation over a number of days, it was decided that the barge could not be salvaged. The only alternative was to sink it in a controlled manner. 
Work to prepare the barge for sinking was carried out off Camden Head. The barge sank at about 21:00 hours on 29 December.

The ship had part discharged and retained on board about 35,000 tonnes of crude oil.
At 22:30 hours, the exhaust gas uptake high temperature alarm sounded and the temperature reading was seen to be 10 degrees Celsius above the alarm setting. The engine was slowed to reduce the temperature and the waste heat unit was inspected for hot spots. None were found and the engine speed was increased at 23:45 hours.
At 01:15 hours on 8 November, when about 11 miles from the nearest land, the exhaust gas alarm sounded again and the main engine revolutions were reduced. A further inspection of the waste-heat unit revealed a small area glowing red at the forward, inboard corner. The main engine was stopped and the crew were alerted.
The fire within the waste-heat unit could not be fought directly and the main fire fighting effort concentrated on boundary cooling. After fire burnt a hole through the casing,  several portable C02. extinguishers were discharged into the unit through the hole, without effect.
The ship's engineers initiated the proper established procedures and stopped the engine. Although the weather was favourable and the current tended to take the ship offshore, given the proximity of the land and the nature of the cargo, the Master requested that a tug be made available to tow the vessel back to Whangarei.
The fire in the waste-heat unit had reached such intensity that areas of the generating section's steel tube banks, and a small section of the steel casing reached fusion temperature with resulting meltdown of the materials.
At daybreak, the crew prepared for the tow by hanging off the starboard anchor and ranging the anchor cable. A tug arrived at 09:55 hours and the tow was connected at 11:32 hours. By 21:00 hours, the ship had been brought safely to harbour and it subsequently anchored in Bream Bay.
The fire was contained throughout 8 November and into 9 November by boundary cooling. It was extinguished by 15:15 hours on 9 November, but it was considered prudent not to open up the unit until the area had cooled further. In all the fire burnt for some 39 hours.
Officers of New Zealand's Ministry of Transport, Maritime Transport Division, were appointed by the Inspector to undertake an initial investigation on behalf of the Australian Department of Transport and Communications.

In the afternoon of 22 October, a signal from a float-free emergency position indicator radio beacon (EPIRB) was detected by the search and-rescue polar orbiting satellite system (COSPAS-SARSAT), about 300 miles east of the Philippine Islands, close to the area of the typhoon Colleen. The EPIRB was identified as coming from the Daeyang Honey.
An initial air search by the United States authorities based on the Island of Guam was hindered by bad weather associated with the typhoon. On 25 October, in better flying conditions, a liferaft was located and ships in the area were requested to search for survivors and wreckage.
On 26 October the liferaft was relocated and a little later the EPIRB, surrounded by debris, was also sighted. The motor ship  Azaleaeverett was diverted to the position of the EPIRB, where debris and the beacon were found, but no survivors. At about the same time, the motor ship Bum Ju located the liferaft and positively identified it as belonging to the Daeyang Honey.
The Daeyang Honey had loaded iron ore on a number of occasions at the Australian ports of Dampier and Port Hedland.

The ship involved in the collision failed to stop and render assistance, and Champers, which was dismasted in the collision, was eventually assisted by the fishing vessel Star Track. After the mast and rigging had been cut free, the yacht was able to return to Gladstone under engine power.

As a result of the collision paint and rust from the unidentified ship fell on to the Champers deck.

An exhaustive check of shipping in the area found that only one ship was known to be in the area of the collision at the time, the Russian flag tanker Antares.

Although the tanker's reported position at the time of the collision was at least two miles from the charted position of the yacht, samples taken from the paint and rust that had fallen to the Champers deck and samples subsequently taken from the hull of the tanker established that it was very likely that the samples had a common origin. It was therefore considered probable that the Antares was the other ship involved.

As a resuit of the collision there was flooding, initially in the engine room and compartments immediately aft There was also pollution of the seas by the vessel's bunker fuel.
The vessel developed a starboard list and sank stem first in 86 metres of water in position 02° 27.4' North, 101° 36.3' East.
 A rescue operation was mounted after which three persons were known to be deceased and a further six persons remained missing.
 The cause of the collision was a joint failure of the bridge watchkeeping personnel on both vessels to maintain an efficient lookout and to subsequently follow the International Régulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972.

The ship was in a condition that she could have detected the presence of Sea Hope on her radar screen 15 minutes before the collision took place. She was also in a condition that, at 7 minutes before the collision, she could have detected the presence of Sea Hope by radar 2 miles off bearing 50° on her port bow. Thus she came to be in a condition that she could not avoid developing close-quarters situation with Sea Hope.
Sea Hope, which left Port  Muroran, Hokkaido, for Port Kashima, Ibaraki Prefecture, with her cargo holds empty, was navigating off  the coast of Iwate Prefecture at its South-Eastern point taking her course to 196° TB and at her half speed of 8 knots. 8 minutes before the collision, she detected the presence of Kaiyo Maru by radar 2 miles off bearing 55° on her starboard bow. Thus being in a condition that she could not avoid developing close-quarters situation with Kaiyo Maru, Sea Hope continued to navigate, neither reducing her speed to the minimum at which she could be kept on her course nor taking all her way off if necessary, to collide with Kaiyo Maru

Blue Goose of Arne was dismasted and also holed on the starboard hull.

The Longevity turned about and provided assistance to the lone yachtsman in effecting repairs to the yacht's hull, after which both ships continued on their voyages.

Some time later the Blue Goose of Arne suffered further damage when it plunged off a wave crest, as a result of which it flooded and sank. The yachtsman supported only by his lifejacket and clutching  his emergency radio beacon, was eventually rescued by helicopter.

At 15:30 hours the engines were stopped again because the lub-oil temperature was increasing. The engines were allowed to cool down and opened for investigation. The ship’s engineers found that the astern clutch plates were seized and therefore these were generating heat due to friction.  The crew decided to replace the damaged clutch plates. The repairs were estimated to be completed the evening of 13 January 1992.During the time the ship was drifting in open seas, and exhibiting “not under command” signals. 
On 12 and 13 January 1992, the ship drifted at rate of about 2 knots in a southeasterly direction towards the Japanese coast.
By 14 January 1992, the ship had drifted closer to the Japanese coast.  The repairs were still not completed. At 11:25 hours the master anchored the ship about 1.4 miles off Me Shima Island in position 33° 59 ’N 130° 41’ E.   While anchoring, the ship’s port anchor brake was damaged. At 14:25 hours, the starboard anchor was dropped and the ship managed in that position which was about 0.4 mile from the coast.
At 15:00 hours the repairs  were completed. The master decided to heave up anchor and to proceed to a sheltered anchorage at O Shima, which is about miles away, to check the gear-box system and machinery before resuming voyage. At 15:43 hours, the anchor were aweigh  and the ship commenced steaming. At 16:16 hours, the chief engineer informed the master that the engine has to be stopped. The master waited for about half and hour but the engines could not be re-started. The chief informed him that the air pressure was low and there were trying to top it up. The master waited for about half and hour more. Still there was no response. By then the wind had freshened and was blowing form north-northwest (toward the coast) at force 7. At 17:45 hours, the master ordered to let go the starboard anchor to three shackles in the water. However, the ship continued to drift towards the shore. 

At 18:15 hours, the master called the Japanese Coast Guard for assistance. The coast  Guard despatched a tug. Before the tug could come close to the ship she grounded at 18:20 hours.
