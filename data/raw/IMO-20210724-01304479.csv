Sea conditions were north-westerly winds of less than 10 knots and smooth seas.  Conditions worsened as the ship reached Cape Campbell on the eastern side of Willaumez Peninsula, where rough seas, rain and strong north-westerly winds prevailed; causing spray from the sea to come over the starboard side of the ship.  Passengers moved to the port side of the ship or inside to keep dry.  The movement of passengers combined with the wind exerting a force on the starboard side of the ship, resulted in the ship developing a port list.  At 0220 on 2 February, the Chief Mate altered the course to make for the Nessup Channel.  At 0330, the Master was called to navigate the ship through the Siassi Islands and into the Vitiaz Strait.  On leaving the lee of Umboi Island, steering became uneasy, as winds had increased to between 20 and 30 knots and the seas to 3.0 m.  The Master took the ship out of auto-pilot, into hand steering and took the helm.  The prevailing winds and the imbalance of the ship caused her to maintain port list, exposing more of its starboard side to the weather and sea.  At 0615, a large wave hit the ship on its starboard quarter.  The stern was pushed to port and the ship heeled heavily over to port, causing her to come beam onto the north-westerly.  The Master lost steerage of the ship and was not able to bring its head back around the port.  A second wave hit the starboard side of the ship as it was returning to the upright, causing it again to heel over to port.  The heel angle was far greater and resulted in the ship’s port side becoming submerged causing water to flood into the accommodation.  The ship was heeled over for a shot time when a third wave hit the exposed hull and the ship capsized.   Due to the speed at which the ship capsized, the Master did not have time to give a mayday signal.  The Master and 3 employees were in the wheelhouse as it filled up with water.  Three of the four men were able to swim to safety before the ship sank.  Liferafts, lifejackets and buoyant flotation devices floated to the surface.  Survivors managed to swim to liferafts, while others were assisted on board.  The first rescue ship arrived at 0940; 3 hours after the ship sank.  246 passengers were rescued, 4 were pronounced dead and as many as 161 persons were considered to be missing and presumed dead.
As the ship sank, fuel and bilge oil from the engine room began to float on the surface of the sea.

Dubai, Jan 16 -- Bunkering tanker Lady Moon (137 gt, built 2006) carrying diesel fuel sunk about 500 metres off the coast of Hamriyah, today, but all five crewmen were rescued, according to Sharjah Hamriyah port officials. The vessel started having technical problems when it was 10 nautical miles offshore, officials said. When attempts to fix the issues failed, the Master of the vessel contacted Al Hamriyah Port officials for help. The Master told the port's sea monitors at the control unit that the vessel's engines were struggling. Later, he told them he had lost control of the vessel's steering, and by then the vessel, loaded with diesel fuel cargo, had started sinking. The control unit notified the coast guard, which rushed to the vessel and rescued the five Indian crewmen, officials said. The vessel soon sunk completely, leaving small traces of oil leakage in the water.

Preliminary information indicated that the collision occurred when Alex D was proceeding along the north-east Traffic Lane of the Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) in the Dover Strait, whilst Jacoba was crossing the same lane but on a southerly course. 
  
Soon after the accident, Alex D reported to Griz Nez VTS that she had been involved in a collision with an unidentified fishing boat.  Griz Nez VTS recommended Alex D to reduce speed.  It also provided the details of the fishing boat.  Communication was then established between the two vessels.  No injuries or pollution were reported.

The safety investigation found that in the prevailing circumstances and conditions, the appraisal of the situation and of the risk of collision was inaccurate.  Consequently, until the collision was imminent and unavoidable, neither vessel took any action to avoid the accident.

During the towing operation one spud pile (barge leg) on the barge came loose, lowered itself, hit the seabed and broke off. Later that afternoon, another spud pile came loose and lowered itself to the seabed, resulting in the barge grounding. After an unsuccessful attempt to repair the jack-up unit holding the spud pile, the second spud pile including a pontoon broke off. The tug crew be-lieved that both spud piles and the pontoon were lost and were lying on the seabed.
About three hours after the loss of the second spud pile, the container ship JOHANNA passed the area and collided with one of the spud piles. The spud pile penetrated the hull above the waterline and forecastle deck. The crew did not become aware of the damages until early next morning and JOHANNA diverted to the port of Karlskrona, Sweden, for repairs.
The investigation has established that, on 18 December 2011 at 2300 local time, JOHANNA col-lided with the second spud pile lost by the barge AARSLEFF JACK III on 18 December 2011 at 2010 local time.
It has not been possible to establish for certain what technical circumstances caused the malfunc-tion of the locking pins holding the spud piles, thereby enabling them to come loose and slide out of the hydraulic jack-up unit. However, the wear of the locking pins, the lacking securing of the spud piles and the area and conditions under which the barge was towed are factors that have, with some likelihood, contributed to the breakdown.","Container Ship (Fully Cellular)","Ship rendered unfit to proceed","6363","Germanischer Lloyd (GL)","7131","","12","","","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","2013-09-27",""

The 18 December, at around 10 pm, she was fishing at 3 knots when the skipper noticed that the consumption indicator quickly changed from 80 liters/hour to 140 liters/hour. 
He decided to make a patrol in the engine room and immediately saw a considerable leak of sprayed gas-oil, which seemed to come from the main engine. He then rushed to the wheelhouse, stopped the engine and alerted the crew. A few minutes later an A/B seaman observed a steam coming from the engine room. Another one shouted “Engine fire”. 
The skipper pulled the remote control of the gas-oil tank valves, and operated the fire extinguishing system, after the crew had closed the ventilation flaps. 
The first contact with the MRCC was interrupted and the skipper made a Distress call by VHF. 
At that moment, it seemed to the skipper that the fire was nearly extinguished. A few minutes later when the fire had restarted, he made an attempt to fight the fire with a powder extinguisher. But, as he hadn’t taken time enough to put on a fire protective clothing, he couldn’t approach the engine and discharge the extinguisher.
Then the fire spread to the bridge and the rest of the ship; the crew launched the raft at sea and quickly abandoned the ship.
At 10.44 pm, the crew was rescued by a fishing vessel in the vicinity.","Fish Catching Vessel","Ship rendered unfit to proceed,Total loss of the ship","126","","","","4","","","","","","","","","2015-05-29",""

The cargo work ended on 14 December at 7.00 pm.
The weather forecast for the night of the 15 was bad: a depression with a 995 hPa central pressure over the central Atlantic was moving easterly and deepening. The master informed then the ship’s husband that he wished to stay alongside. However, due to the pre-planned
harbour movements, TK.BREMEN could keep her berthing only until 15 December at 9.00 pm. Thus at 9.00 am on 15 December, the vessel requested pilot and tug in order to sail on
ballast bound to Ipswich (UK).
At 11.00 am on 15 December, TK.BREMEN sailed. Considering the very bad weather forecast for the night (storm Joachim arriving), the master, following the pilot’s advices, decided to go to anchor off Ile de Groix lee shore, in the waiting area with the harbour master’s authorisation. At 12.30 am the ship was anchored with 6 starboard shackles in the water.
At 7.30 pm as the wind had freshened, the ship began to drag the anchor for the first time. As the anchor had been partially heaved up, the master decided to let the vessel dragging the anchor in order to clear another vessel at anchor (DESERT.HOPE). The cable was then veered away and the anchor seemed to be holding.
From 9.00 pm to 9.15 pm the vessel was dragging the anchor. The wind was freshening and veering westerly. At 9.50 pm the vessel was dragging again. TK.BREMEN went out of the sheltered area. From 11.00 pm the anchor had been heaved with the help of the engine. The vessel attempted then to come to starboard in order to haul up and to return to a sheltered anchorage. As she did not succeed, she paid off hard to port, but observing that there was not enough water to wear, she came back to starboard.
Since this moment of time, she was not any more able to fetch to windward and she was making good a south-easterly course leading her to the rocks located in the south of Etel river.
At 00.38 am, the master requested for a tug assistance in order to come back alongside. Considering the weather conditions, SCORFF the available tug did not sail.
At 1.25 am, following the MRCC advice, TK.BREMEN, located off Etel river, cast her
two anchors. They did not hold and the vessel stranded around 2.00 am.
All the crew had then been winched by an helicopter and landed at Lann Bihoué naval air base.

A tug was ordered, but propulsion was recovered and the vessel made its own way back alongside.

Investigation found that one of the oil mist detectors had identified dangerous levels of oil mist and shut the engine down, as designed, although no oil mist was evident.  

Contractors representing the oil mist manufacturers found that the detector’s window heating element had failed.  The purpose of this is to ensure that any water vapour is evaporated which, if it had not, the condensed water droplets will activate the detector in the same way that an oil escape will.  In this case water droplets settled on the window and caused the engine shut down.

Guided by GPS and radar the vessel dropped anchor with four shackles on deck in a distance of 1,6 nautical miles north west of the isle of Houxian Shan. Weather at that time was fine with only moderate wind from the north. The vessel was in ballast with a draft of 6,20 m aft. 
After having discharged her final cargo in Pusan the vessel was instructed to proceed to Shanghai were a new charter was projected to begin. The master was advised to stay outside on the anchorage until further notice but should be prepared to proceed upon short term instruction.
While lying at anchor the standard 1-in-3 navigational watch system was maintained with the master standing watch during the 8-12 hour cycle. Depending on the weather and the surrounding environmental condition the scheduled ratings were ordered to support the duty mate and the master on the bridge. 
On 19 November the anchor chain was dropped to 5 shackles on deck after the weather forecast had advised that stronger winds were to be expected. 
While standing his afternoon watch on 30 November the chief mate detected that the vessel was drifting after northerly winds had freshed up rapidly. Although the master appeared on the bridge immediately the bridge team was unable to prevent the vessel from hitting the near by rocks from the Houxion Shan island only about ten minutes later.
The vessel was stuck on the rocks where the bottom stake was damaged considerably. Still during night the entire crew was evacuated and shorelanded by a local SAR unit. There were no fatalities and no serious injuries. Due to rapid action a serious deleterious effect on the local environment could be avoided. Later, the vessel was salvaged and repaired.
The pattern of the occurrence has provoked the flag State to instigate a full investigation into this marine casualty with focus on the following issues:
                  was the vessel lying at a safe anchorage? 
                  why was the drift of the vessel not detected earlier?
                  why was the engine not avaiable when urgently needed?

As the weather deteriorated, the master intended to anchor at a place inside the island of Bonden, marked on the chart as an anchorage. However, the master was told that  anchorage was not to be used and was consequently advised to either anchor at the anchorage in the open sea, or to take a pilot for anchoring inside the fjord Brofjorden. The master, who for economic and technical reasons, chose not to await steaming at sea, accepted the alternative to anchor inside Brofjorden. Advised by the pilot, EK-RIVER anchored at anchorage G. As the distance to shore was only some 500 m, it was decided to keep a high level of alertness in the engine, and the azimuth propeller in the forward part of the vessel was subsequently made ready for start directly from the bridge. Any other technical preparations were not made, and the engine room watch was not kept.
In the evening of November 25th a strong wind blast from SW made the vessel to drag. The officer and the master, both on the bridge, tried to contact the engine crew, but did not succeed to reach the chief engineer, who happened to be in his cabin, until several minutes later. The chief engineer got hold of the engineer on duty, and they immediately started the procedure to have the main engine running. At the same moment that the main engine was running, the vessel grounded in spite of the master s efforts to run the azimuth propeller, preventing the drift.
The investigation finds that the reason for the grounding was anchoring close to shore under unfavorable circumstances, combined with difficulties for the master to reach the engine crew as the vessel started dragging. Furthermore, it has been established that the anchoring equipment is not designed for anchoring under severe weather conditions.","Oil Tanker","Ship rendered unfit to proceed","10802","","17259","","18","","","","","","","","","2017-01-10",""

Short:
When passing the MOL Efficiency it came to collision between Splittnes. The Splittnes was pushed under the MOL Efficiency and ripped open above and below the waterline.

Extend:
On 22 November 2011, the SPLITTNES was en route to Bremen on the Weser fully laden. The vessel’s command, under pilot’s advice, intended to reduce the speed as far as necessary to allow for the MOL EFFICIENCY, proceeding ahead of her, to turn and berth. There was a strong rising tide and visibility was very impaired due to fog. 
At about 2009  <_ftn1> , the harbour pilot of the MOL EFFICIENCY proposed to the shore based radar guidance that the SPLITTNES pass before the MOL EFFICIENCY turns and berths after all. He was afraid that the SPLITTNESS would not be able to maintain her position. The sea pilot agreed and recommended his ship’s command to accelerate his vessel again. During the attempt to steer the SPLITTNES back into the middle of the fairway, her starboard side collided with the aft port side of the MOL EFFICIENCY. The starboard side of the SPLITTNES was torn open so severely in the process that the vessel very quickly began to list and the crew had the impression she would founder. The severe list caused a number of crew members to panic and they abandoned the SPLITTNES in one of the lifeboats. However, the remainder of the crew on board managed to offset the list quickly by ballasting.
Considerable material damage was caused to both vessels. Nobody was injured. Minor water pollution could be remedied.","Bulk Dry (general, ore) Carrier","Ship rendered unfit to proceed","11538","Germanischer Lloyd (GL)","18964","Solid cargo - Dry bulk","17","0","1","","","","","","","2017-12-14",""

Very little oil is believed to have spilled during the initial breakup, but that could change with the sinking of the stern section. One of the containers lost is believed to contain cryolite, which is toxic and over time will potentially have a toxic effect on shellfish.","CONTAINER SHIP","Pollution,Total loss of the ship","37209","","47230","","","","","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","2015-02-26",""

An ordinary seaman (OS) stationed on the forecastle was tasked with releasing the tug secured to a ship’s line to the starboard mooring bitts through the centre panama lead. 

During this operation, tension was unexpectedly put on the line with the result that the OS sustained serious injuries to one of his leg.  First aid was administered on the forecastle and the OS was placed on a stretcher. 

The vessel proceeded out and later drifted some distance off the breakwater.  It was eventually decided to transfer the injured crew member ashore by placing him on top of the ship’s container lashing gear storage box and lowered by utilising the ship’s cargo crane. 

The intention was to transfer the stretcher from the container lashing gear storage box to the pilot boat and then shore.  Four crew members accompanied the injured OS on this makeshift platform. 
 
On 30 September, at about 0010, whilst approaching the ship, the pilot boat made heavy contact with the container lashing gear storage box resulting in the inadvertent release of the lashing gear storage box’s lifting strops from the cargo crane hook. 

The container lashing gear storage box tilted substantially and the five crew members fell into the sea.

Après un soutage effectué au large de la Cȏte d’Ivoire, il a fait route vers le port ghanéen de Tema pour avitaillement en ammoniac, puis, le 6 vers les lieux de pêche. La pêche a effectivement commencé à partir du 7 septembre à midi.
Du 7 au 20 septembre, la pêche est mediocre. La fin de la marée est prévue vers le 29 septembre. Pendant cette période, il n’est fait état d’aucun incident ou dysfonctionnement.
Le 20 septembre, après trois ‘coups de senne’ dans la journée, le filet, le skiff et ‘l’épave’ (radeau concentrateur de poisons) sont à bord vers 18 heures. Il fait nuit, le vent est faible et la houle modérée.
Le filet (1 500m x 200m), entreposé sur la plage arrière, occupe un espace de plusieurs m³. Le filet est ‘maillé’ au skiff, lui-même pose sur la rampe AR.
Deux graisseurs effectuent le plein du skiff tandis que les membres de l’équipage dînent.
A la fin du repas, la plupart des marins du bord, à l’exception des marins de quart regagnent leur cabine.
Vers 18h45, le graisseur de quart, repassant par le pont à l’issue d’une ronde vers l’avant du navire, aperçoit de la fumée provenant de l’arrière tribord, à la hauteur de la cheminée.  Il crie ‘fume’ et tout l’équipage se trouver très rapidement sur le pont. Il gagne ensuite la machine où il constate la presence d’un feu provenant de la partie supérieure des échappements de la cheminée.
Le capitaine entend cet appel depuis la passerelle. Il aperçoit les flames et déclenche l’alarme incendie.
Le second capitaine et le lieutenant, équipés des tenues d’incendie, tentent de lutter contre le feu avec les manches à incendie, mais la pression est insuffisante. L’usage des extincteurs s’avère lui aussi inefficace.
Le chef mécanicien, lui aussi alerté par les cris, tente d’atteindre les commandes de déclenchement du CO₂ et les vannes d’isolement de gas-oil.  Il n’y parvient pas, à cause de la fume et de la chaleur.
Le maȋtre d’équipage a pendant ce temps démaillé le skiff du filet et l’a mis à l’eau, ainsi que la vedette.
Le feu se propage au filet.  Le capitaine decide l’évacuation du navire peu après 19 heures.  Les embarcations s’éloignent de quelques centaines de mètres du navire afin de se prémunir des effets de l’incendie.
L’équipage assiste à la progression de l’incendie vers la partie central (machine et château), puis l’avant du navire (installations frigo)
D’abord recueilli par l’AVEL VOR et le GUEOTEC le soir meme, tout l’équipage sera conduit à Port Gentil à bord de l’AVEL VOR le lendemain.
Le PERE BRIANT finira par couler dans la nuit du 21 au 22, dans les fonds de 500 à 1000 m, à quelques dizaines de milles au large du Gabon.

The pilot boarded at 11:14 hrs. Shortly afterwards, the anchor was on deck. The vessel slowly began to pick up speed and turn to port in order to head for Lauis Ledge Light, which marks the entrance to the traffic separation scheme (TSS).
At a distance of about 2.5 to 3 nm, the CEBU TRADER approached the TSS from the opposite direction. The ship's command of the FIDUCIA checked the CPA and TCPA and concluded that there was enough time to enter the TSS before the CEBU TRADER.

The pilot suddenly recommended that port rudder be set in order to allow the CEBU TRADER to pass on starboard. This was subsequently agreed to by the ship's command.
The third officer plotted the current positions on the nautical chart. Based on the position at 11:35 hrs, the ship's command concluded that the FIDUCIA was too far west and heading directly for the Lipata Bank.
The reef was supposedly not visible as there was hardly any wind and high tide had just set in. Even the marker buoy was absent. The pilot was then made aware that the vessel was approaching the shoals. He played this down, but nevertheless recommended starboard 10 as the CEBU TRADER had just been passed.
Shortly after, the ship's command noticed a sudden decrease in the depth of the water to less than 10 m. Consequently, the engine was stopped and then set to HALF ASTERN. Despite that, the ship's command could only conclude that the FIDUCIA had run aground.

The ship's command immediately started to take steps to establish the state of the vessel.
Arrangements were made with the pilot to call a tug that could haul the FIDUCIA free.
After that, the owner was informed. After several unsuccessful attempts to haul the vessel free, this was put back to the next high tide at 2400, at which time the FIDUCIA was hauled free as expected and continued her voyage to the port of Cebu.

There were no reported casualties.  Golden Trader was proceeding Southbound, off the fishing port of Thyborøn while Vidar was steaming an Easterly course.  Although visibility at the time was reduced, both the navigational officer of the watch (OOW) and the look-out on board Golden Trader reported sighting Vidar visually at about three nautical miles.  The OOW on board Golden Trader, who had been observing the fishing vessel on radar for some time, explained that he could not alter course to starboard due to the presence of other fishing boats. 

Several days after the collision, the Swedish Accident Investigation Authority informed the Marine Safety Investigation Unit of a severe pollution, which had been reported on the Swedish Western coast.  Analysis carried out during the course of the safety investigation confirmed that the oil washed ashore had leaked from a breached heavy fuel oil storage tank fitted on Golden Trader. The heavy fuel oil storage tank had been damaged during the collision.  It was estimated that the total amount of heavy fuel oil (IFO 180 cST, density 0.991 mtm-3) lost on board was approximately 450 m3. 

A safety investigation was conducted jointly by Malta (lead investigating State) and Sweden (substantially interested State).  The Swedish Accident Investigation Authority’s contribution is presented in sub-sections 1.4 and 2.6.  The safety investigation identified several factors in the navigation procedures on both vessels which led to a close quarter situation and subsequent collision.  Other factors related to the aftermath of the collision, and which were relevant to the severe pollution on the Swedish coast, were also identified. 

The immediate causes of the collision were determined to be an inaccurate interpretation on board Golden Trader of the developing close quarter situation and potential navigational practices on board Vidar.  It has also been determined that the major oil spill that reached the Swedish coast had not been detected because calculations and estimates were based on inaccurate information.","Bulk Dry (general, ore) Carrier","Ship rendered unfit to proceed","28420","Lloyd's Register (LR)","48170","Solid cargo - Dry bulk","24","0","0","","","","","","","2014-10-03",""

At 01.15 on Tuesday 6 September 2011, an explosion occurred on deck on board the Norwegian chemical tanker Clipper Sund at quay in Antwerp. One man died from injuries sustained in connection with the explosion. 
The explosion occurred as the result of a reaction between two incompatible cargoes.
The vessel was loaded with mono nitrobenzene, nitric acid and aniline. After the discharging operations had finished, there was aniline in the vessel’s port drip tray and nitric acid in the vessel’s drainline, only separated by a single ball valve. 
The investigation concludes that the factors that triggered the explosion were that the able seaman who was alone on deck at the time of the accident caused the opening of the ball valve separating the aniline and nitric acid. The incompatible cargoes reacted immediately and caused heat and gas generation. In all probability, the able seaman understood that something was wrong and reacted by closing the valve in order to limit the extent of the damage. On the contrary, this made it impossible for the gases in the drainline to escape. The pressure in the pipe increased rapidly and caused an explosion.
The purpose of the investigation was to identify the underlying causes of how the opening of a single valve could lead to an accident of this kind. The investigation has focused on design, operational factors and regulations.
The applicable regulations, relevant industry standards and the classification society’s interpretation of them permitted the vessel’s drip tray to be directly connected to the vessel’s drainline, only separated by a ball valve. In the case of the Clipper Sund, the drip trays were not just connected to the drainline, but, through them, also to cargo tank 5C. The AIBN submits a safety recommendation to Det Norske Veritas and the Norwegian Maritime Directorate in this connection, proposing a change in the current classification regulations and the interpretation of the IBC Code.
The shipping company had not carried out vessel-specific risk assessments of loading and discharging operations that should have formed the basis for the introduction of risk reduction measures, including the drawing up of necessary plans, procedures and instructions. The shipping company states that it has implemented a number of measures on four sister vessels in order to prevent similar accidents in future. The AIBN nevertheless submits a safety recommendation to the shipping company relating to the carrying out of risk assessments of loading and discharging operations and the establishment of necessary operational procedures based on such assessments. 
The current regulations give the shipping company a great degree of freedom to choose how to conduct its risk management. No specific requirements apply to how risks on board are to be identified and how risk assessments are to be carried out. The regulations thereby provide the shipping company with little support for conducting satisfactory risk assessments that, in turn, put the shipping company in a position to implement relevant measures.
The AIBN is not aware of the quality of risk management work in other shipping companies, but, given that the same requirements for this work apply to small and simple shipping organisations as to large shipping organisations, the AIBN cannot exclude the possibility that the quality of this work can vary considerably. A safety recommendation is submitted to the Norwegian Maritime Directorate to the effect that it should map the status of the shipping companies’ risk management work with a view to further targeting the work on guidelines/guides to help the shipping companies to establish satisfactory risk management.","Chemical Tanker","Ship rendered unfit to proceed","2613","","","","","","","","","","","","","2014-07-03",""

The oil fell on to the top of the running starboard main engine and ignited. The crew went to muster stations and made a re-entry to fight the fire.  The re-entry team continued to attack the fire with portable AFFF extinguishers and noticed the stbd engine had not shut down via the normal emergency stop. Quick acting shut off valves were operated to starve the stbd engine of fuel.  The engine room was evacuated and the crew closed down to prepare to operate the Novec fixed fire fighting gas system. The Master decided to delay Novec suppression due to concern that the stbd engine was not confirmed to be stopped which may suck the gas out of the space and with the compartment closed down, the smoke was now diminishing from the funnel area. There was also a concern by the Chief Engineer that the bow thruster engine required an air supply from the engine room to keep the exhaust valve open and a black out would jeopardise this. The Master considered that loss of the bow thruster would mean the vessel's head could not be kept into the wind and may accelerate the drift towards the shore in the deteriorating weather while tug assistance arrived.   

With the engine now showing stopped a second re-entry was made and the fire was extinguished. With tug assistance now on the scene, the vessel went to anchor while hot spots were cooled and preps made for the transit into harbour. There were no injuries.

The most likely cause of the seal failure was poor engineering standards employed in assembly of the cooler during its overhaul by contractors. Ignition may have been avoided had spray protection been fitted to the coolers end plates.    The fire fighting effort by the BA team was effective against the localised fire. The fire was able to reignite due to the failure of the stbd engine shut down system and probably due to a jammed fuel rack. 

On dismantling it was found that the cooler end plate studs were not full screwed into the cooler body and that minimal torque was required to loosen the end cover securing nuts which were only supported using flat washer and nt lock washers. .  It was also found that the incorrect ""O"" seal was used by the overhaul company.  The company has been informed of the poor standrds and have agreed to review it quality assurance procedures.

The vessel was moored alongside the terminal of Oleon Scandinavia AS (previously Jahre factories) at the former whaling inland port of Sandefjord in Southeast Norway.  The vessel was due to commence loading operations.  The loud explosion was heard from the nearby town of Sandefjord. 

There was no fire on board but the vessel suffered severe structural damage.  The force of the explosion inside cargo tank no. 2 port, deformed and ruptured adjacent bulkheads to cargo tanks nos. 1 port, 2 starboard and 3 port.  The longitudinal bulkhead in way of water ballast tank no. 2 port was also deformed.  The explosion inside the cargo tank also lifted and bulged up part of the main deck (tank top).  There were no injuries to persons or loss of life.  However, one crew member who was on deck at the time, was transferred to hospital soon after the accident and was treated for shock.  No pollution was reported and there were no leakages or cargo tank breaches to the sea. 

At the time of the accident, the vessel had about 1200 m3 of water-based drilling mud residues, which were considered as slops and were distributed in all the cargo tanks in different quantities, except for cargo tank no. 4 port, which contained approximately 158.6 mt of waste oil.  The water-based drilling mud had a higher density than water and the former may have settled and became non-fluidised in the bottom of some of the cargo tanks. 

When the vessel arrived at the Loading Terminal and attempted to load on top, the cargo was not reaching the cargo tanks.  Compressed air was blown through the cargo lines by the Terminal in order to clear the bottom of the drop lines, which were under the top level of the mud sediments. Prior to the accident, cargo lines to tanks nos. 1 port and starboard had been blown through by air for about 10 minutes.  The lines were safely cleared. 

Compressed air was then connected to cargo tank no. 2 port since this tank also had the drop line blocked at the bottom.  Minutes later, the explosion occurred. 

The cause of the explosion was not immediately identified.  However, laboratory analysis of residue samples from the cargo tanks revealed that traces of hydrogen sulphide ( H2S), high levels of phosphorus and methane (CH4).  Hydrocarbon peaks were also present.  Bacterial analysis indicated that high values of methane- oxidising (methanotrophic) and methane-producing (methanogenic) bacteria were present in the cargo tank residue samples.  It was concluded that on a balance of probabilities, spontaneous ignition might have occurred as a result of the presence of a phosphine (PH3) and diphosphine (P2H4) / air mixture, in a flammable CH4 / air mixture atmosphere inside cargo tank no. 2 port . 

The safety investigation revealed other factors, which were relevant to the explosion inside the cargo tank, including issues with the information on the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) and the adopted loading procedure. 

As a result of the safety investigation, one recommendation was issued to Transport Malta’s Merchant Shipping Directorate as the flag State Administration.  The recommendation is intended to disseminate the lessons learnt and bring to the industry hazard awareness associated with the carriage of drilling mud.  Two recommendations were made to the ship’s managers, which aim to highlight the importance of Material Safety Data Sheets and ensure the dissemination of the safety lessons identified in this safety investigation.","Oil Tanker","Ship rendered unfit to proceed","4401","Lloyd's Register (LR)","6672","Other cargo","15","0","0","","","","","","","2014-09-11",""

The engineer was attempting to pump overboard into the sea some oily water that had gathered in the ship’s bow thruster space. With assistance from another crewman he had carried a portable salvage pump down into the fish hold so that it was close thrusters space. The pump’s petrol engine ran for a total period of more than an hour in a compartment with no mechanical ventilation and little natural air circulation. This caused very high levels of CO to accumulate within the fish hold because the petrol engine’s exhaust gas fed directly into the space.

Le 15 août 2012 vers 4h30 du matin, le navire pétrolier chimiquier GUYENNE quitte, lège, Port-La-Nouvelle pour le port de Castellon (Espagne) où il doit charger. À 8h40 survient  une alarme de défaut débit du circuit d’huile thermique. 
 Le fluide thermique est chauffé par la chaudière de récupération à la mer et par la haudière de mouillage au port, il assure le réchauffage du fioul de propulsion et de la cargaison. 
 Les pompes de circulation de ce circuit sont immédiatement stoppées manuellement. 
L’inspection du circuit révèle que l’une des vannes télécommandées à fermeture rapide est  fermée et un mécanicien tente de l’ouvrir manuellement. L’augmentation de la pression dans le circuit provoque l’ouverture de la soupape de sûreté. 
Le mécanicien, qui poursuivait en vain ses tentatives d’ouverture de la vanne,  aperçoit un début d’incendie lié à une pulvérisation au niveau du joint de la bride amont de la soupape de sureté. Il sort par l’échappée machine de la cheminée et donne l’alerte. 
 Le moteur principal est stoppé, les vannes à fermeture rapide du circuit combustible  sont fermées, le circuit d’huile thermique est mis en vidange et les volets de ventilation sont  fermés après arrêt de celle-ci. 
 Vers 10h30, le local machine est évacué et le CO2 est déclenché. 
 L’extinction est confirmée vers 12h30 (absence de point chaud). 
 Le navire sera pris en remorque le lendemain matin 16 août pour rallier Marseille qu’il  atteindra le soir même. 
 Les réparations des avaries provoquées par l’incendie seront effectuées à Marseille. 

Le second évènement : 

 Après réparations par un chantier de Marseille, le départ ayant été différé à deux  reprises, le navire appareille pour effectuer les essais en mer le vendredi 14 septembre en  début d’après-midi. 
 Peu avant le départ, l’alarme de défaut de circulation d’huile thermique, la même que  le 15 août à 08h40, se déclenche ainsi que, 20 mn plus tard, l’alarme d’incendie dans la  chaudière de récupération qui est interprétée comme intempestive. 
 En rade de Marseille, les essais se déroulent normalement de 15h00 à 16h00 et sont  considérés satisfaisants. 
 Environ 30 mn plus tard, le chef mécanicien constate que la soupape de sécurité de  l’huile thermique située à l’entrée de la chaudière de récupération est ouverte. Il ouvre une  vanne de purge de ce circuit vers la caisse d’expansion. Il constate alors que la vanne d’entrée dans la chaudière de mouillage, normalement ouverte, est cependant fermée. Il l’ouvre. La pression dans le circuit chute de 10 à 6 bars. La vanne de purge est alors fermée mais la température du fluide n’est pas revenue à la normale.  
De la fumée apparaît au niveau de certains calorifugeages dans la «zone chaudière», puis l’alarme incendie de cette zone se déclenche. 
Les arrêts d’urgence (moteur principal, ventilation, etc.) sont actionnés et la lutte  contre l’incendie (limitée à la zone des chaudières) débute immédiatement, le développement  du feu est maîtrisé, mais il couve encore, le CO2 est déclenché. 
 Après une évaluation de la situation en liaison avec le DPA et le GPMM pour un 
retour du navire au port, deux remorqueurs sont commandés. Les marins pompiers embarquent au moment où le navire commence à s’amarrer. 
 Le samedi 15 septembre à 00h48, le navire est amarré Forme 8 du port de Marseille. 
 L’extinction est confirmée à 01h23 (absence de points chauds). Les pompiers débarquent. 
 À 02h04, la détection incendie est de nouveau opérationnelle.

The 60m-long Skyline Barge 19 had been used for installation work at St George Wharf and was to be towed to Gravesend. At about 0900, the tug Steven B was secured to the barge's stern in a 'push' mode and Chiefton was connected forward in a 'pull' mode. Two pilots and the barge owner's representative were positioned forward on the barge. After the tow has successfully completed the slow-speed downriver bridge transit, Chiefton's and Steven B's engine powers were increased to 95% and 70-75% respectively.

As the tow approached Greenwich Ship Tier, it was set to the south under the influence of the flood tidal stream. Manoeuvring action was taken to prevent the barge hitting one of the buoys, but this was unsuccessful. The barge then collided with Chiefton, causing the tug to capsize and founder. Chiefton's skipper and mate were subsequently rescued from the river but the engineer/deckhand, who was a non-swimmer and was not wearing a lifejacket, was lost. His body was found and recovered 3 days later.","Towing / Pushing Tug","Ship rendered unfit to proceed","","","","","2","","","1","0","0","0","0","0","2017-03-17",""

After checking tanks and cargo holds bilges soundings, the crew found out that ballast DB WBTKs Nos. 1, 2 and 3 have a various extent of sea water levels inside; those tanks were empty before the incident; however; the other ballast water tanks as well as cargo holds bilges were found empty. The vessel’s Chief officer tried to pump out the water from DB WBTKs No. 1, 2 and 3 but the sounding was increasing gradually and the Master ordered them to stop pumping out and gave instructions to continuously monitor the sounding of the said  tanks. 
The Vessel approached the anchorage position of Lat. 29⁰49.3’ N / Long. 32⁰31.2’ E while listing to starboard side. Two hours later, the above mentioned DB WBTKs have been found full and the vessel list to starboard side was steady at 3.3 degrees.

cargo of bulk Iron Oxide (2, 238.056 mt.)

A pilot assisted in navigation down the Gironde river disembarking from the vessel at 1545 hours close to Buoy 13A. The Master then piloted the vessel under assistance from shore radar until the Fairway buoy was reached. At this time he set an initial course of 300 degrees and was bound for Rotterdam. 

             Conditions were said to be;
             Wind – West 20 knots        Ship said to be rolling gently about 5 degrees either way.
             No pitching was experienced and a speed of 8.8 knots was maintained.

At about 2330 hours the Master observed the vessel develop a starboard list of 5-7 degrees., a list 
which gradually increased until at 2345 hours, having had the ballast tanks and bilges checked for 
water, the Master realised that the cargo may have shifted. The Master then put the wheel to 
starboard which resulted in the vessel becoming upright before falling over to port. At this time he fully realised that the cargo was shifting and causing a free-surface effect.
The vessel was then brought round onto a course of 120 degrees the intention being to head back 
towards Bordeaux.
At 0115 hours on 22 July 2001 VHF contact was made with the Bordeaux pilot station and they were 
advised of the vessel’s problem and their assistance was requested. However, the vessel’s condition 
became uncontrollable and the list increased to an estimated 35 degrees.
The crew had all been advised of the problem and they were assembled and, when the vessel was 
stopped, launched the liferaft in preparation for possible abandonment of the vessel.
At this time, approximately 0200 hours the Master sent out a MAYDAY call on VHF 16.  A shore station acknowledged the call and advised that a rescue helicopter would be in 15 minutes to uplift the crew. A vessel in the vicinity, Arklow Fen also responded and was heading for the stricken vessel.
The Master and crew were subsequently uplifted by a helicopter from the Bordeaux Rescue Centre.
The vessel was abandoned in a position 17.8 nm x 120 degrees from the fairway buoy.

Later that day a salvage tug the “Abeille Langedoc” was dispatched to render assistance arriving on              scene at 1300 hours. A second tug “Boluda” was sent to assist with salvage operations. The  Master and Chief Engineer were also taken onboard to assist in the operation. An oil spill was observed              in the vicinity. It was also reported that the list had increased to 60 degrees.
The tug “Abeille Langedoc” and another vessel “VB Oleron” made fast to the vessel and commenced towing the ‘Union Neptune’ towards La Rochelle.
At 1833 hours it was advised that the vessel had listed further and was in danger of sinking. At              1900 hours approximately it was reported that the vessel had sunk.

On the afternoon of 22 July 2011 an aircraft flew over the location and observed the vessel still to be showing a small section of bow above the surface. Photographs show that this was the case.
 It was stated that the depth of water was 35 metres however, the vessel itself is over 87 metres in length therefore it may be presumed the vessel’s stern could possibly be on the bottom. This, as reported, constitutes a hazard to navigation.

Owners/operators are apparently currently engaged with salvors.

The hypotheses on the cause of the fire were built around the acetylene torch and/or hoses which were inside the space.  Whilst it could not be ascertained as to what had started the fire, it was possible that the fire started as a result of acetylene leakage coming in contact with an ignition source, oxygen coming in direct contact with oil and grease, or oxygen enrichment inside the emergency fire pump space.","General Cargo Ship","","25719","DNV AS (DNV)","36120","","24","0","0","","","1","","","","2014-09-11",""

Après l’appareillage, Allures fait route au près bon plein, sous 2 ris et génois partiellement déroulé.

Le navire est encore relativement protégé par la côte et le vent est régulier, établi à 30 noeuds au 280°, les vagues de 1,50 mètre à 2 mètres. La vitesse est de 12,6 noeuds.
Peu après, alors que le capitaine contrôle le réglage des voiles et la tension dans les haubans (à partir d’un écran multifonctions du poste de barre), un violent craquement se fait entendre, instantanément suivi de la chute du mât dans l’eau, et de la bôme sur le flybridge. Le capitaine est prisonnier sous la voile mais se dégage rapidement pour évaluer la situation : le second, qui se tenait appuyé au caisson tribord, à proximité du poste de barre, est mortellement blessé par la bôme. La cliente et l’hôtesse-marin, toutes deux sur bâbord, ne sont pas blessées. Immédiatement, l’équipage prend en charge les clients pour éviter toute panique et les garder en sécurité. Au vu de la situation, le capitaine lance un Mayday qui sera relayé par un motor yacht vers le CROSS Méditerranée Corse.

Le 26 Mai 2011 au matin, le caseyeur Stessary, mis à l’eau à partir d’une remorque, quitte la plage de Pirou pour se rendre sur ses lieux de pêche.

Il y relève ses filières de casiers et retourne à terre avec une pêche de 120 kilos de crabes rangés  dans des caisses en pontée.

Le vent est de secteur ouest de plus de 25 nœuds, la houle est formée et à l’approche de la côte la mer est difficile et tend à déferler du fait de la remontée des fonds.

According to the timetable each port stay was approximately one and a half hour. This made cargo operations intense in order to finish in time. In Trelleborg, the cargo was unloaded through two openings in the stern of the vessel, one on deck 3 and one on deck 5, connected to ramps on the quayside.
On the 25th of May 2011 at 21.00, the vessel berthed at quay berth 9 in the port of Trelleborg. Shortly after arrival the passengers disembarked and the unloading of the cargo, consisting of cars, trucks and trailers, commenced. The chief officer who was in charge of the cargo handling was standing on the ramp at deck three preparing for the loading. At the same time the last trailer was about to be unloaded with a terminal tractor (tug master). At 21.15 the trailer was reversed out from the ship and onto the ramp. When reversing, the driver of the terminal tractor did not have a view over the area behind the trailer. Therefore the driver stopped and when he saw that the chief officer waved at him to continue he backed out on the ramp. Suddenly a person from ashore rushed towards the terminal tractor and waved to the driver to stop.
As the driver stopped and stepped out of the vehicle he saw the chief officer lying on the ground face down between the back wheels of the terminal tractor. He immediately called for help and the rescue service was alerted. The chief officer had been hit by the back of the trailer, fell between its wheels and then had been dragged along the ground by the terminal tractor for approximately ten meters. As a result he sustained serious injuries and was taken to hospital.

Clipper Point sustained damage to her starboard quarter and her steering compartment was holed below the waterline.

During a scheduled arrival into the port, the wind increased to 34 knots and the ship was set closer to the port’s South Quay than was intended. After Clipper Point narrowly missed one of two ships that were alongside South Quay, the master attempted to turn the ship to port in his usual manner; however, the ship was out of position and only one of the ship’s tow bow thrusters was operational. At 05:16 hrs the starboard quarter of Clipper Point made contact with South Quay, holing the ship below the waterline. The tug skipper, who had been standing by in his ship to assist Clipper Point conduct the turn, decided not to engage his tug due to the risk of damage to his own ship. Clipper Point’s master persevered with the turn and the ship subsequently made contact with two other ro-ro ferries that were berthed at N°. 2 and N°3 linkspans before it was finally secured at N°1 linkspan.

The four crew members were positioned on deck, two on either side of the trawl deck aft, each pair responsible for one net.  The skipper was in the wheelhouse, at the winch controls and watching through the aft window.  The port net ran out smoothly, however the starboard net became snagged.  As one of the crew members crossed over the port net on his way to the rail, he stumbled and lost his footing as the port net was running out and carried him overboard with it.  With the motion of the vessel the crew member was being alternatively pulled under the stern of the boat and pushed back out behind.  It is possible that the stern of the vessel came down on top of him and struck him on the head rendering him unconscious, as he released his grip on the net and stopped moving.  The skipper, realising what was happening, stopped the vessel immediately.  As soon as he saw the crew member floating out from under the vessel, he started to bring the boat around.  The life raft was inflated and the crew member was pulled into the raft.  CPR was administered for 15 minutes, while a ‘Mayday’ call by VHF, giving details of the vessels position was sent, however the call was not answered.

During its approach to a holding position, outside the installations 500m zone, where it intended to undertake, a full pre-entry systems check there was an apparent loss of the functionality of the ships manoeuvring equipment. The vessel entered the 500m zone without stopping and impacted the platform's jacket, resulting in minor structural damage to the installation and damage to the vessel.
Control of the vessel was regained and she moved away from the installation using her stern thruster and carried out a damage assessment. There was some water ingress which was initially controlled by the vessels pumps and later stopped indicating damage to the Port Azimuth, and hull plating damage, but the integrity of the hull appeared not to have been compromised.

At 13.37 the vessel was released from the field to proceed to back port to be dry docked. There were no injuries or environmental damage.

The subsequent investigation found that the master had tested both the forward and stern thrusters at the aft control position before transferring control to the forward panel.  At this point it appears he selected auto-pilot.  At 700 m from the platform he eased power to ""slow"" but this had no effect.  He then de-clutched the forward thruster to reduce speed and set the control to full astern but the stern thruster did not respond, indeed the speed was reported to have increased. A short time later a blackout occurred as the increased load on the generators resulted in a cascade failure as the speed droop resulted in low frequency tripping of the units.

The vessel was fitted with an unusual control configuration.  When in manual control the thrusters were controlled in heading by a rotating joystick which incorporated a lever controlling the propeller revs.  When the master rotated the joystick, the thruster did not rotate as it was still being controlled by the auto-pilot.  The master applied increased propeller revs expecting the resultant thrust to stop the vessel.  This in fact increased the vessel¿s speed in the direction controlled by the auto-pilot and caused the contact. 

The master was unfamiliar with the propulsion control system and the company¿s induction procedures were not comprehensive enough to provide a proper system familiarisation. The master was unaware that he had left the thrusters under the control of the auto-pilot.

Upon completion of the process, the vessel departed to her discharge ports of Geelong and Adelaide, Australia.  Effective ventilation and clearing of the fumigant necessitated that the re-circulation blower was run continuously for at least four days.  Instructions to start the ventilation of the cargo holds were received on 08 April 2011, however, it was not until 11 April that the cargo holds were ventilated because of adverse weather conditions.  All cargo holds covers were cracked open, manholes fully opened and arrangements made for natural ventilation.  However, five hours later, all had to be secured again due to forecasted adverse weather conditions.  It was decided, however, to only leave natural ventilation and a re-circulation blower.
On 12 April 2011, a loud explosion was heard at about 0330 (UTC) just forward of the bridge.  Preliminary inspection by the crew revealed that No. 5 hatch forward cover was open, whilst the aft end of the hatch cover was damaged.  Dense white smoke was observed coming out of the cargo hold.  All securing cleats, bolts, and hydraulic cylinder rams were damaged.  The crew applied boundary cooling, however, smoke immediately subsided, and no traces of fire were observed.  It was also observed that the power cable for the connection box on the re-circulation fan seemed burnt and the blower had fallen down to the first ladder platform.
No injuries or further structural damages were reported.

After the collision, Philipp did not stop and neither her officer of the watch (OOW) nor her master tried to communicate with Lynn Marie to see if the fishing vessel required assistance. Philipp was about 20nm away from the location of the collision when her master eventually informed the coastguard of his vessel's involvement.
The MAIB investigation identified that Philipp's OOW had not properly assessed the risk of collision with Lynn Marie and that his actions to try and avoid the fishing vessel were contrary to the requirements of the collision regulations.
Lynn Marie's wheelhouse watchkeeper did not notice Philipp's alterations of course towards his vessel and did not realise that collision was imminent until it was too late to take effective avoiding action.
A recommendation has been made to Philipp's managers aimed at raising the competency of its bridge watchkeeping officers and ensuring that the navigation and anti-collision aids fitted on board its vessels are used effectively.

At the time of the accident the MV EMSSKY was, with a tug fastened to the stern swinging off its berth position with the last forward mooring line still fast ashore.
On being ordered by the vessels master to let go all forward the line could not be taken off the bollard as it was jammed by other turns on the bollard.
The second officer who was operating the winches ordered the loose end of the mooring line to be put on the port winch capstan and tried, after telling both crew to stay clear, to pull the line free. This allegedly caused the rope to break and struck the later deceased on the head.
Immediately the unconscious and bleeding seaman was tended to and a shore side ambulance alerted. The vessels Chief Officer and assisting other crew attempted to reanimate the lifeless body, without success.
After returning to its initial berthing position local authorities boarded the vessel and a doctor officially declared the seaman’s death.

It is believed that he was manually guiding the net onto the rotating net drum when he was pulled onto the drum and sustained fatal injuries. The ship was later found about 28 miles from her last sighted position after an extensive search and rescue operation.

The investigation concluded that a drawstring toggle on the left-hand side of the storm hood on the skipper’s jacket had become entangled in the net as it was being hauled on board. Evidence indicated that the skipper had then reached towards the operating control lever to stop the net drum. He was unable to do so, and died as a result of injuries to his upper body.

On impact, Cosco Hong Kong’s officer of the watch felt an unusual vibration and immediately put the engine telegraph to stop. He did not see Zhe Ling Yu Yun 135 immediately before or after the collision and he was unaware of what the container ship had struck. Cosco Hong Kong remained drifting in the vicinity for over 1 hour while the master tried to establish what had happened. In the absence of any evidence that a collision had occurred, Cosco Hong Kong then resumed passage to Yangshan, China.

The Taizhou Maritime Rescued Co-ordination Centre was notified that Zhe Ling Yu Yun 135 was missing at 20:21 hrs, 18 hrs after the collision. An air and sea search failed to find any trace of the ship or her crew. The Wreck of the Zhe Ling Yu Yun 135 was eventually located on 17 March 2011 close to the position of the collision.

En circunstancias que había terminado de recoger un aparejo de anzuelos de 10 millas de extensión y cuando se dirigía a 8 nudos a recuperar otro aparejo calado, sufrió una escora progresiva a la banda de estribor hasta volcarse completamente. La escora permanente fue producto del ingreso de agua de mar a la factoría del pesquero, a través de una pequeña puerta, utilizada para el ingreso de la pesca a la factoría, presumiblemente debido a los golpes de mar que recibía la nave en dicho sector, cuando dicho compartimiento estaba vacío, lo que no les permitió conocer oportunamente la deficiencia de estanqueidad.
El rápido ingreso de agua al sector, la falla de la bomba de achique eléctrica instalada al interior de la factoría, producto de la propia inundación; sumado a las adversas condiciones de mar y viento, y a la condición de que con 20 ° de escora los trancaniles de la factoría quedaban bajo el agua, fueron factores que contribuyeron a que el volcamiento y posterior  hundimiento del pesquero ocurriera en un corto lapso de tiempo.
El abandono de la nave comenzó por iniciativa propia la dotación, utilizando las balsas salvavidas, procedimiento el cual no se apegó a lo dispuesto, debido principalmente a que el equipo de gestión no dispuso el oportuno abandono de la nave, al desestimar el riesgo de volcamiento.  No obstante lo anterior y a pesar del mal tiempo, 38 tripulantes salvaron la vida, encontrándose 4 de ellos desaparecidos.
La activación de la señal de Distress desde el equipo de radio, y la falta de transmisión del equipo de posicionamiento satelital de la nave, fueron elementos claves para que el MRCC Chile coordinara efectivamente los medios de rescate.

In the wheelhouse were her skipper and mate. The swell was between 4 to 5 metres and there were isolated rain showers which reduced visibility to between 1 and 2 nautical miles. The fishing vessel was showing her navigational lights and lights to indicate that she was trawling.
The skipper became aware of a merchant ship on the fishing vessel’s starboard side. He was able to see the vessel both on radar and on his AIS and could visually see the vessels masthead lights and red side light. He identified the vessel as a container ship and saw that she was proceeding at 18 knots. Although the closet point of approach was small, the container ship would pass astern of the fishing vessel.
The skipper adjusted his own course slightly to port to increase the closest point of approach between the vessels. Shortly after this, the skipper saw the green side light of the container ship and assumed that the merchant ship had adjusted his course to port.
On the bridge of the container ship, the master was acting as officer of the watch. He had not rested for over 36 hours and was slightly irritable. While the master was explaining the correct administrative methods to a junior officer, the lookout report a light fine on the container ship’s port bow. The master identified the light as a fishing vessel and concluded that the container vessel was overtaking He adjusted his vessels course by 10 degrees to starboard and then became engaged in adjusting the radars settings in an effort to locate the target on the display. 

Two minutes later, the lookout reported the light again, this time very close on the starboard side. The master immediately took avoiding action by completing a wheel over to starboard but was unable to prevent the container ship colliding with the fishing vessel. Two of the fishing vessel's crew were thrown overboard but both were later recovered, one by the rescue boat from the container ship who had remained on station following the collision. The fishing vessel was badly damaged and was towed by to port by the local lifeboat.

	In the morning of 25 January 2011, the owners instructed the crew of Bina Marine 59 to open some manhole covers (void spaces) onboard Bina 98 (LoA 67m) for survey purposes. Both Bina Marine 59 and the unmanned Bina 98 are owned by the same owner.
The next day at about 1100hrs, three surveyors boarded Bina 98 to survey the open void spaces. Subsequently, the surveyors requested the crew of Bina Marine 59 to open more void spaces; namely no. 1(S) and no. 6(P). The respective manhole covers were removed at about 1400hrs.
Apparently, two surveyors were on the main deck taking photographs of the no. 6(P) void space when one of them fell into the space. The remaining surveyor (not wearing breathing apparatus) immediately went into the space to assist his colleague but came up almost immediately when he felt dizzy. He cried for help.
Indonesian AB Aprianus Paladang was the first crew to arrive and saw the surveyor lying on the bottom of the no. 6(P) void space. Without wearing any breathing apparatus, he went into the space but was soon lying unconscious on the bottom.
At about 1500hrs, the 2 men (surveyor and AB Aprianus Paladang) were rescued by crew (wearing breathing apparatus) from Bina Marine 51 and Bina Marine 65 - these vessels were lying in the vicinity. However, only the surveyor recovered and the unconscious AB was rushed to the local hospital but was pronounced dead.
Investigations revealed that it was an unintended entry (no. 6(P) void space) and thus no precautions were taken e.g. rescue and resuscitation equipment available for immediate use by the entrance to the space, designated attendant etc. There is no evidence to suggest that the deceased, a suitably trained crew, was unaware of the precautions when entering enclosed spaces. In all probability, his entry into the no. 6(P) void space, on his own accord, was simply an act to save life. But it was also a fatal act and could be attributed to the human error of incorrect recognition .
Following this incident, the owners revised their ‘Entry into Enclosed Spaces’ check-list (written in English and Bahasa) vis-à-vis IMO Resolution A.1050(27) ‘Revised Recommendations for entering enclosed spaces aboard ships’. This Resolution includes a section on safety management:
3.3.2	Crew members should be trained, as appropriate, in enclosed space safety, including familiarization with onboard procedures for recognizing, evaluating and controlling hazards associated with entry into enclosed spaces.
