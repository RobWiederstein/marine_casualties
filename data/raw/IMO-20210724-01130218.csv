In addition, there were 12 passengers, all military personnel, on board. 

The weather forecast for the planned voyage predicted gale and storm, and during severe rolling a tank container on the forepart of the weather deck loosened from its lashings and caused damage to some jerrycans. Eventually, leaked petrol was ignited by sparks generated by one or more tank containers that slid across the deck, steel against steel. The fire quickly spread to other jerrycans and tank containers on the forepart of the weather deck and became immense.

The firefighting effort was successful because the ship’s officers and crew were able to expediently exploit and manage the resources available under adverse circumstances.

Situated in the starboard wing, the chief mate was unable to keep his footing and also fell into the water. He held on to some floating timber until he was picked up by a pilot boat that had rushed to assist.
 
He was taken to hospital for observation but suffered no lasting injuries. The timber that fell overboard was recovered over the next few days but had to be declared cargo damage.
Since the ROSEBURG sailed under the flag of Antigua & Barbuda, a joint investigation was carried out with ADOMS IID. This concluded that a ship may not begin her voyage when she is overloaded and thus compromises the safety of her and her crew.","General Cargo Ship","Serious injuries,Ship remains fit to proceed","1999","Lloyd's Register (LR)","3026","Solid cargo - General cargo","8","","","0","0","0","1","0","0","2018-07-23",""

Six people died.  The number of missing people has not been officially disclosed. 
The ship left Lan island for a 30-minute evening trip to Pattaya.  An engine problem prompted passengers on the first deck to rush to the second floor, causing the ship to list and eventually sink.
Marines from Thailand’s Sattahip Naval Base were deployed to search for the ship and the missing passengers.
The National News Bureau of Thailand indicated that the passenger ship was licensed to carry up to 150 people.  The local police said more than 200 passengers were on the ship.
Investigations continue to ascertain the cause of the accident.

Both engineering watch keepers were absent from the engine room at the time of the outbreak, the Second Engineer had gone to an engine store on the upper deck  to select fuel valves to be re-conditioned and the engineering watch rating was working in the electrical store also  on the upper deck. During this time, a fire broke out in the engine room which was initially detected by the second officer via the fire detection panel’s visual and audible alarms located on the navigation bridge. The Master arrived shortly thereafter to the bridge upon hearing the alarms. Efforts were made to enter the machinery spaces to determine the location of the fire but they were unsuccessful due to the presence of heavy smoke. Flames were seen on the starboard side of the engine room. The main engine stopped resulting in a blackout as electrical power was being supplied by the shaft generator. 

All of the crew were accounted for, the engine room openings were closed and the Master instructed the Chief and Second Engineers to activate the halon fixed fire-fighting system, which initially appeared to suppress the fire. However it soon became apparent to the Master that the fire was gaining ground and he contacted the ship’s agent in Iceland and the managers DP in Estonia to brief them on the situation. The ship’s agent in turn notified the Icelandic Coastguard who broadcast a MAYDAY RELAY although no MADAY call was made by the ship. The decision by the Icelandic Coastguard to broadcast a MAYDAY RELAY was made following an evaluation using sound professional judgement to facilitate the safety of life at sea in an expedited manner. Consideration was given for the type and degree of the emergency, the locale of the emergency and prevailing weather conditions, and previous experiences conducting search and rescue operations consistent with similar circumstances. 

The crew mustered initially on the navigation bridge and later on the boatdeck. Two inflatable liferafts were launched on the port side and one was prepared for launching on the starboard side. 

The wind was estimated by the Master to be about 20/25 metres per second, Beaufort force 7/9 with a heavy sea and swell. FERNANDA was approximately 6 miles offshore and was rolling heavily. 

The Icelandic Coastguard called the ship requesting information and the Master advised that the situation on board was deteriorating rapidly. It was agreed that a helicopter would be dispatched to airlift the crew from the vessel. It was airborne at 1351 hours. At 1436 hours the evacuation of the crew commenced from the open deck forward of the bridge. All eleven crew members were successfully airlifted from the vessel at approximately 1456 hours. They were landed ashore at Reykjavik, Iceland at 1532 hours.

The Icelandic Coastguard tasked a lifeboat from the Vestmannaeyjar Islands, a tug, and their salvage ship THOR to attend the vessel.  Fire-fighting efforts continued overnight until 0230 hours on 31 October 2013 when it was determined that the fire was contained although not fully extinguished.

At 1200 hours on 31 October a number of firefighters from the Icelandic Coastguard boarded the vessel to prepare for towing it to Hafnarfjordur where the vessel was eventually berthed at 0830 hours on 01 November 2013. 

While at Hafnarfjordur, as firefighters from Reyjkavik were preparing to board, it was decided to open the stern ramp to ventilate the cargo spaces which were smoke logged. This decision was also made in order to facilitate access so that foam could be used to extinguish the fire in the remaining hot spots. The action of opening the stern ramp allowed fresh air to enter the cargo compartments of the vessel and the fire flashed again generating large volumes of smoke. A decision was quickly taken to tow the vessel out to sea to allow the fire to burn out. The stern ramp was in the open position and was subsequently lost to the sea. 

The fire continued to burn mainly in the cargo compartments. Heat seeking cameras on THOR confirmed that there were very high temperatures in the lower tween deck and cargo hold. Sea water was directed on to those areas to cool them. 

At 0900 hours on 06 November FERNANDA was towed into Grundartangi Port, Iceland where she berthed starboard side to the quay. Fernanda was identified to have a distinct starboard list. An inspection of the entire vessel was undertaken by the Icelandic Police Service. 

On 09 November 2013 an inspection of the vessel was conducted by the Flag State Investigator in the company of fire-fighting and investigating officials from Iceland. 

On 13 November 2013 the vessel was sold to a metal re-cycling company in Iceland for demolition and de-contamination.

Sea water and all hazardous waste on board was removed and taken to a disposal facility. The remaining fuel oil and sludge was removed and re-cycled.

There were no injuries or fatalities among the crew, the firefighters or the Icelandic Coastguard.

At the time of the accident, she had a cargo of 35 railway cars.  Her maximum draft was 3.58 m. 

The safety investigation concluded that Smat dragged anchor in Westerly gale force winds, with storm force gusts and rough seas, to which the anchorage area off Poti is exposed.  The master’s efforts to regain control of the situation proved ineffective and unsuccessful in the prevailing conditions. 

No injuries were reported, and there was no pollution. 

The safety investigation also found that the anchoring position, the lack of appreciation of the deteriorating weather conditions, the consequent excessive loads on the anchoring system of the ship while she remained on anchor and attempting to recover the anchor, had all contributed to the accident.","Ro-Ro Cargo Ship","Ship remains fit to proceed","5775","Russian Maritime Register of Shipping (RMRS)","6698","Solid cargo - Roll-on/Roll-off","16","0","0","","","","","","","2017-02-16",""

The accident resulted in significant structural damage in way of the vessel’s cargo length area. 

The safety investigation identified a number of contributing factors which led to the accident.  At the time, the pressure/vacuum valves were not operating as designed.  Moreover, there were no pressure gauges fitted locally on the main deck for the duty crew member to check the pressure inside the cargo tank.  Remotely, inside the cargo room, the audible pressure alarm had been muted and a loading rate in excess of the cargo tank designed rate was not addressed. 

The safety investigation also concluded that in a complex dynamic environment, hazards during the cargo loading operations went undetected by the crew members.","Chemical Tanker","Ship rendered unfit to proceed","3280","Bureau Veritas (BV)","4916","Liquid cargo - Chemicals","14","0","1","","","","","","","2017-02-17",""

Cheng Lu 15 initially planned to sail to Muroran Port, Japan, at around 16:30 on October 14, 2013 after unloading all its cargo at Pohang Port, but the vessel decided to berth at the north side of the anchorage number M19 near Yeongilmanhang in Pohang, at around 18:00 on the same day due to concern that it would come across Typhoon Wipha.

On October 15, 2013, in the southern waters of the East Sea where Cheng Lu 15 was anchored, a wind wave advisory had been issued at 09:00 which was replaced with a high seas warning at 13:00. 
On the same day, aware of Cheng Lu 15’s position, Pohang VTS Center advised Cheng Lu 15 to heave up the anchor and move out of harbor limits. 
However, Cheng Lu 15 did not comply and instead, decided to set two anchors using the engine.

Cheng Lu 15 could not withstand the deteriorating weather, and it had been at anchor when the left stern came into contact with the north breakwater of Yeongilmanhang in Pohang at around 17:45 of the same day.

Immediately following the initial contact, a strong northeast wind pushed Cheng Lu 15 southwestwards, repeatedly slamming it into the breakwater. It eventually tore a hole in the left stern and sank the vessel. 

From this Marine casualty, Cheng Lu 15 sank due to a hole created in its left stern. Among 19 crew members, 8 were rescued and 11 (10 Chinese and 1 Vietnamese nationalities) were confirmed dead.

The times referred to throughout the report are local. On September 10 2013, at approximately 20:00 hours, the fishing vessel (F/V) CHONA, left the port of A Corua with two crew members, a skipper and a seaman. The vessel was authorized to fish in the Cantabrian national fishery with minor arts and engaged in pot fishing. That evening, they were picking up and dropping pots by the Ria de A Corua.Moments before the accident, about 01:00 hours on the 11th, the sailors were in the stern lifting one of the swaths of pots. At one point, several successive waves embarked water over the stern, so that it was flush with water. Then the crew cut off rigging in order its weight did not submerged more the stern. The bilge pumps did not have sufficient capacity and crew tried unsuccessfully to bail out the water with buckets. The efforts made by the crew were in vain and the stern of the boat remanined completely submerged. The skipper had time enough to call the F/B FUXA OS VENTOS which operated very close. The F/B FUXA OS VENTOS came quickly and the two crew members of the E / P CHONA jumped to her. They tried towing the F/B CHONA but due to the large amount of water shipped and her heel they decided to cut off the rope. Once the towing rope was cut off the boat sank in position 4323,33'N / 00822,33'W and about 15 m deep. The seamen were able to retrieve some personal belongings, a tank of gasoline and some ropes and buoys that floated. CONCLUSIONS The F/B CHONA's fishing license was in force and the titles of the crew were valid for the fishing area. The last clearance resolution record was the day January 17 2013 and was valid until 17 July 2013. This clearance was expired at the time of the accident. This clearance resolution stated a limitation of the permitted area for fishing to this boat: ""... navigation for LOCAL FISHING is authorized without having liferaft on board, in the waters of the Ria de A Corua inside the line between Punta Herminia to Punta del Seixo Blanco "". The boat was at the limit of the authorized area.The E / P CHONA was a boat without deck. This type of boat is not fitted with drain gates, thus shipped once the water has no way out, except through bilge pumps or manually. He was carrying two electric pumps that could bail out a flow rate of 13.2 m3 / hour each. They probably worked at first, but the batteries that were located at the stern of the boat become useless when the water ingress. Furthermore, bilge bailing is not sufficient if a massive flooding happens. The bailing capacity was calculated for a small amount of water, such as entering a bilge in usual conditions. The moulded depth of the E / P CHONA was 0.66 m. His draft was unknown. According to statements by the boat crew was already seated aft, besides being the two fishermen in the same area and at the same time they were heaving up the rig from this area. As a result, the freeboard of the boat astern was considerably reduced.Furthermore, the vessel was receiving the NE wind of about 16 knots (upper limit of force 4 Beaufort scale). According to meteorological report they suffered sea between rough and very rough seas and swell of N component with significant wave height of about 1.3 m and average period of 5 seconds.From the above it follows that the boat sank when facing weather conditions of excessive severity for the type of boat.","Fish Catching Vessel","Ship rendered unfit to proceed,Total loss of the ship","1.39","","","","2","0","0","","","","","","","2019-10-25",""

At 13:11 hours the N/V TOFIO reported to the VTS having passed under the bridge Carranza and proceed to sea. At that time he was informed that a pilot was out to sea with a merchant vessel and subsequently enter the container vessel M/V WEC BRUEGHEL, bound for the container terminal of Cadiz. Moments later, crew in N/V TOFIO spoke directly to the pilot embarked on the B / M WEC BRUEGHEL and both vessels agreed to pass starboard to starboard; that is, the merchant would approach the red buoys of channel and B / H Tofino to the green buoys. Meanwhile, the fishing vessel F/V PLAYA YERBABUENA, was moored in the harbor of Cadiz, unloading her catch of the day. At 13:17 hours the fishing vessel finished downloading and pushed off to go to El Puerto de Santa Mara to stock ice. The skipper cruised in the port of Cadiz to the mouth of the harbor and, once exceeded, his intention was to go straight to El Puerto de Santa Mara (a port just in front of Cadiz, both inside the Cadiz Bay. At 13:30 hours the F/V PLAYA YERBABUENA collided with her port side bow against the port side of the N/V TOFIO in front of the entrance to the port of Cadiz. There were no injured or pollution damage but fishing vessel suffered severe material damage in all her bow area. After inspections and relevant communications took place between both vessels, as they were in the proximity of the port, the fishing vessel returned with slow speed to her berth in the fishing harbor of Cadiz, while the navy vessel continued her travel to destination. CONCLUSIONS The collision occurred because the lookout of F/V PLAYA YERBABUENA did not remain at all times an effective visual and auditory surveillance, also using all available means appropriate to the circumstances and conditions of the moment, to fully assess the situation and the risk of collision (excerpt from Rule 5 COLREG). In the N/V TOFIO such lookout existed. However, they could have taken additional measures of surveillance, behavioral ship and acoustic signals agreeing to navigate near the harbor entrance and following an unusual procedure, as it was navigating to the sea on the opposite end to dictated by Rule 9 of RIPA. The absence of AIS signal from the fishing vessel probably prevented the bridge team of N/V TOFIO to become aware of the movements of F/V PLAYA YERBABUENA. The use of two communication channels in a complex environment with multiple users such as the Bay of Cadiz, channels 14 (pilots) and 74 (VTS), plus Channel 16, not subject to the same requirements all of them, which could affect important information were lost or that it did not come to all parties. An important decision as the passing maneuver ""starboard to starboard"" of two important ships in front of the entrance to the Port of Cadiz should have been communicated by VHF channel 74, and not by the channel 14, so that all participants in the system, all ships and boats sailing inside the bay, were aware of it. However, in the case under review, the above action would not prevent collision course because the fishing vessel was not listening to this channel. This may indicate that the requirements of the STM are not fully adopted by its members.","Fish Catching Vessel","Ship rendered unfit to proceed","45.81","","","","13","0","","","","","","","","2019-10-25",""

Prior to commencement of work on the 24th August, a safety meeting including safe job analysis in connection with cleaning of the cargo holds was conducted.  Both the deck- and engine crew which was involved in the cleaning operation was participating. The meeting included a check of the personal protecting equipment as well as a discussion regarding the upcoming job, which method and equipment to be used, and risks involved in the cleaning operation.
The engine crew was responsible for the cleaning cargo hold number five, in accordance with the routines of the company. The crew entered the cargo hold via a protected, fixed ladder in the forward part of the cargo hold, and started the preparations for work. Two men were in the cargo hold, while one man was situated on deck by the hatch coaming to assist with lowering equipment, regulating the water supply to the high pressure machine etc. The crew had hand held radios for communications. 
During the cleaning process, the motorman was standing in a portable aluminum ladder operating the high pressure machine; one man was supporting the ladder and controlling the safety line, while the third crewmember was occupied with miscellaneous tasks. Shortly after nine o’clock, an additional man from the engine crew entered the cargo hold to assist with the cleaning procedure. He started to assemble scaffoldings for use when cleaning the forward and aft bulkheads.
After completion of cleaning one part of the bulkhead the motorman moved down the ladder in order to move the ladder to the next position. The engineer which supported the ladder had to move to the side in order to give way for the motorman on his way down. Just about one meter before he reached the tank top, the motorman raised and disconnected the safety line from the harness. The engineer shouted to him to inform him he should wait as he was not yet down in a safe position. At the same time the motorman suddenly fell backwards. His safety helmet fell of just before the back of his head hit the tank top. The accident happened at approximate 0920 local time.
The engineer noticed that the motorman was unconscious and was bleeding from the back of his head. He supported the head and shoulders of the motorman in his lap in order to try to stop the bleeding. At the same time the engineer called the rest of the crew in the cargo hold for attention, and to get assistance and inform the rest of the crew about the accident.
The master was out on deck at the time of the accident when he heard the call on the radio that one crew member fell and got injured in cargo hold number five. Together with one other crew member, he immediately climbed down in the cargo hold. Some of the crew brought down a resuscitator from the hospital and commenced first aid procedures. After a while a mobile stretcher with neck stabilizer was lowered down in the hold. The motorman was transferred to the stretcher, strapped and hoisted from the cargo hold. The crew used manpower, rope and blocks in order to hoist the injured motorman from the cargo hold, as the master decided not to use the ships cranes due to some swell.
After they brought the motorman up on deck, he was transferred to the ships hospital where he got oxygen supply and the crew monitored the pulse and blood pressure of the injured motorman.
In the meantime the master contacted the company’s emergency telephone number, and at 1001 the master contacted the nearest coastal radio station which was Keelung in Taiwan, China. Keelung CRS relayed the master to NRCC Taiwan, China were helicopter rescue was ordered. The master changed the ship’s course in order to shorten the distance for the helicopter.
The helicopter arrived at 1141, and 1157 the injured motorman was transferred to the helicopter by hoisting him in the ship’s stretcher. The helicopter headed for shore, and landed at the base at 1250. The motorman was transferred from the helicopter base to the hospital by ambulance. At 1529 the hospital reported the motorman was declared deceased.","Bulk Dry (general, ore) Carrier","Loss of life","30078","","","","","0","","1","","","","","","2015-12-07","2018-12-03"

CONCLUSIONS OF THE INVESTIGATION: The causes that contributed to the accident are:1. Collective protection measures were not adopted in the area despite the workplace had clear risks. The CIAIM estimated that the work environment would improve by adopting procedures and a slight transformation of the maneuvering zone. For example, the following measures would be taken:a. Stow coves reels to prevent tangling during maneuvers . In addition, a spool brake provided would have increased the possibility of holding the tension of rigging.b. Providing cover these boats maneuver corridors between fish compartments or between them and the side to enter or leave the area aft bulkheads quickly and safely.c. Do not allow a single man to carry out the net run off ; should always be another crewmember nearby. In his absence, the skipper should be able to directly observe the maneuver area without difficulty.d. Make announcements during the maneuver by a button sound a buzzer on the bridge, with a sound audible and differentiated enough, or similar system.e. Reduce noise bridge devices as possible during maneuvers of hauling and run off as part of an established procedure.2. Procedural collective protection measures despite being an activity at risk were not adopted. For example:a. The fishing gear gone off procedure should occur more restraint, hoping that the ship actually aminorase speed.b. There was not enough staff to allow help immediately in case of an accident, or existing staff on board was not willing to help but attention to other works occur.c. Were not aids available in place to facilitate the monitoring and reporting.3. Inflatable life-vests, probably the best personal protective equipment that could be used in this case, were not used to mitigate the consequences of a fall to the sea. Vests were aboard. In the event that the crew would have put the work vest on, the thrust force generated by the firing of the device could have allowed his release or, in the worst case, the recovery of his body.4. The choice of the particular model of vest was made without taking into account the characteristics of work aboard the F/B LUCERO UNO. The crew was not in favor of putting on the work vests available to them on board because, in their opinion, were uncomfortable and likely to snag the fishing gear.5. The evaluation of occupational hazards of the ship was not well done.","Fish Catching Vessel","","14.29","","","","3","0","","","","","","","","2019-11-19",""

As per the client’s requirement this cable was to be laid south of HAI-NAN TAO, South China Sea which was loaded at port of Nan Tong on some earlier date. 
By midnight of 29 July the vessel arrived near the work site and then maintained her position at 18˚ 24.3´N 110˚ 04.3´E using DP mode. 
The cable laying operation including its burial by plough commenced on 30 July in morning hours. At 1800hrs the vessel was in position 18˚ 21.36´N 110˚ 08.38´E. 
On 31 July at 1800hrs the vessel was in position 18˚ 18.68´N 110˚ 11.99´E, continuing cable laying operation. The operation continued day and night using starboard side LCE system with some stoppages due to adverse weather or equipment break downs. Crew worked in 12hrs on 12hrs off in rotation and relieved each other for meals. 
On 20 August, at 0600hrs the vessel was in position17˚ 48.30´N 110˚ 44.1´E and maintained this position till noon. Crew was engaged in splicing the cable. 
Due to change of cable specification with larger diameter the master decided to lay it by DCE using port side equipments and chute. As per instructions of master at 1715hrs, the crew started preparing to shift the cable from starboard side system of LCE to port side on DCE which was of higher SWL. 
The cable shifting required good seamanship practice and experience. It was being performed for the first time on board and there was no laid down Cable Shifting Procedures. 
The shifting of cable was carried out under the supervision of Chief Officer. Communication was maintained with bridge. The weather experienced during this time was moderate sea and swell with good visibility. 
Deck crew prepared to shift the cable by initially taking the load of the cable, using Siemens stopper of 7 ton SWL. The stopper was secured to cable by wrapping it around with the gripping band fastened at open end of stopper. The super line was then passed through eye of Siemens stopper with its one end secured to bollard and other end taken to capstan for lowering or heaving up cable as required. 
After the stopper was well fastened around the cable, the weight was taken by super line. The cable from inboard side was then slackened and laid on port side. Incidentally around 1813 hours the cable 
slipped through the stopper with excessive force and 3 Crew members who were standing within the bight of the rope were hit by the moving cable. The impact of slipping out cable to sea was so sudden that one of the crew within the bight of the cable fell so severely that he died on the spot and other two were seriously injured. 
The vessel immediately suspended the cable laying operation and headed for medical aid towards port of refuge. On 21 August morning vessel reached port Sanya and the casualties were landed and taken to hospital.

Due to the fact that the decomposition of this fish fat usually creates a volatile and extremely flammable gas called trimethylamine (IUPAC name: N,N-dimethylmethanamine), supposedly overcame its threshold concentration of inflammability in the air, being necessary only a spark to ignite it. Explosion lower limit :  2,0  Vol.-% (49 g/m3) Explosion upper limit: 11,6  Vol.- %   (285  g/m3) 

When the victim, on course of his duties on board the fishing vessel, arrived to the kitchen which is right next to the fish closed deck (connected by an opened door at the time), he felt an intense smell of rotten fish and/or ammonia-like, but anyway he switched a lighter. By doing this, caused the ignition and a violent spreading of the fire (explosion) also to the places nearby that had oxygen to burn (dining/rest room and sleeping room). This caused a violent consumption of oxygen and therefore, burned the victim, fixtures (luminaries), a television set and caused the bulkheads (made of light wood and plastic material) to have been torn from their original positions. 
After switching on the lighter (and in a fraction of a second) the victim bent down and tried to protect his face with his arms, which caused him to have multiple burn damage on his upper members, torso and face. 

The facts that the kitchen is so exiguous and with an opened door that lead directly to the fish closed deck and also the inexistence of a dangerous atmosphere alarm device (fixed and/or portable) contributed to the event sequence: 
    1. The vessel arrived to the port, in order to be moored and the fishing nets were stored with fish residues (there was no washing nor cleaning of the nets); 
        2. The nets were stored in a closed compartment, without appropriate ventilation and possibly with an air temperature above 25°C, for more than 24 hours; 
        3. The crew (including the victim) arrived to the vessel two days later, unaware of any danger on board; 
        4. The fisherman/victim arrived to the kitchen and smelled the air which was with a stronger smell of ammonia-like than usual; 
        5. Even though in presence of a high volatile and inflammable substance, the victim switched on a lighter inside the kitchen area – Casualty event.

The contributive factors for the accident were (not intended to be by the order of the event sequence): 
  
1. Lack of training that led into a misinterpretation of the reality, facing the data obtained by the smell. It led the victim not to carry on safety procedures such as opening the portholes (in order to have a lower concentration of dangerous gas), the use of a mask or to close the door of the kitchen (it could be more effective if it would be closed on the day after the fishing labour); 
 2.  Besides the lack of training, the victim didn’t have any alarm device that could warn him about the presence of a dangerous atmosphere; 

3. For those conditions, the ship didn’t have forced or enough natural ventilation of this confined space; 

4. Possibly it was an high temperature inside the confined space (peak of summer); 

5. The concentration of the trimethylamine overcame its lower limit of explosion (2,0  Vol.-% (49 g/m3)); 

6. The nets were not enough cleaned or washed in order to ensure the safety of its storage on board the vessel “EÇA DE QUEIRÓS”, for more than 24 hours; 

7. There are no procedures on board to deal with this kind of danger. 

The above factors 3; 4; 5 and 6 are connected in a way that 3; 4 and 6 directly contributed to 5. The factor 3 could be a contribution to factor 4. Factors 7; 1; 3 and 6 are connected as well.","Fish Catching Vessel","Serious injuries,Ship rendered unfit to proceed","82.71","","","Solid cargo - Fish in bulk","","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","2018-05-25",""

The vessel departed from Ho Chi Ming City (Vietnam) on 10 July 2013 and was bound for Ghana/West Africa. Kiani Satu was fully loaded with 15.000 tons of rice in bags.
The first 25 days of the sea voyage passed uneventful when on 3 August in the morning an engine room alarm indicated an dangerous overheating in the main engine.  As a first measure the revolutions of the main engine wer reduced and eventually stopped after a closer look revealed that the main engine was suffering a scavenge air fire.
The fire and  source of the overheating was successfully repelled,  but the main engine could not be restarted.
As the vessel was drifting towards the South African East Coast the situation needed solving.
 After drifting for almost 5 days the vessel finally ran aground in the morning hours on 8 August 2013 near Knysna, on a prestine beach in a nature reserve area. Earlier attemps of the master to keep the vessel in position about 30 miles off the coast with both anchors dropped failed after the vessel dragged both anchors as the weather rappidly deteriorated.
Already an earlier attempt to safe the vessel had failed. An offshore supply vessel (OSV) orderd by the company after an emergency call from the master, could not establish a connection. Heavy weather with strong winds and violent seas made it impossible to connet the tow. After several attemps to rig the towing gear failed and the working conditions for the crew on the forecastle of Kiani Satu became unsafe the attempts were aborted.

The Kiani Satu crew remained unharmed and were all airlifted to shore with first daylight on 8 August 2013. 
To avert an environmental catastrophy in the sensetive coastal region the South African Marine Safety Agency (SAMSA) ordered a suitable salvage tug on-scene, which was able to establish connection to the grounded Kiani Satu on 12 August 2013. 
On 17 August 2013 the structurally damaged Kiani Satu was refloated after an experienced salvage team in cooperation with helicopter support had invested ongoing efforts to free the vessel from the beach.
SAMSA directed the managers of Kiani Satu to remove the vessel from the South African Exclusive Economic Zone by the next day. Consequently, the salvage tug  towed the casualty away from the coast during the 17th and continued to do so on 18 till 20 August. On 21 August 2013 Kiani Satu sank in a position about 98 miles off the coast in a water depth of about 1000 meters.
Due to the lotal loss of the vessel this accident is a very serious marine caualty as per the Casualty Code for which consequently a marine safety investigation shall be conducted.The flag State of Kiani Satu has reached agreement with the substantially interested coastal State South Affrica to jointly conduct this investigation, whereby Antigua & Barbuda Investigation Unit  has taken the lead.

The blast, not noticed by the crew at first, caused bulkhead destruction, two breaches in the hull and a fire that set off alarms of ship and forced the captain to activate fire fighting procedures . The situation was solved with the commitment of the crew and with the means available on board, but further assistance was sought from Alcudia s Pilot and also from SAR services, sending the port tug PUNTA TORRE and the rescue boat SALVAMAR SAIPH. These both boats accompanied HSC JAUME I and offered towing services and scorted the ship to her berth. The ship was docked in the port of Alcudia around three in the morning. No injured neither pollution of the marine environment was produced as a result during the accident. The vessel suffered serious damages that immobilised her for months. ORIGIN OF ACCIDENT Investigation soon pointed to a crack on the low pressure DO feeding pipe for cyl. n 16 of starboard inner main engine (SIME). It caused the DO to be spreaded out into the atmosphere of the E/R and allow the development of an explosive atmosphere. CAUSES 1) Material analysis of broken pipe showed that the immediate cause for the break was due to excessive vibration during an unknown period of time. 2) It was found also that an anti-vibration clip for named pipe was missing. This clip was part of the original setting of the motor. Its absence explains the increased number of cycles of the sectioned pipe. 3) It is the CIAIM s belief that this piece missing happened in an indefinite moment in the past, but not immediate to the accident. Inspection, control and maintenance works carried out in the engine room by crew and shore based workshop staff did not detected its absence and there were not procedures adopted to survey and or inspect thoroughly these clips. 4) The DO projection consequent to the breakage of the pipe could have been avoided if the motor would have been fitted with efficient containment means. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS 5) The shot of emergency fuel stop to affected areas was decisive to fight the fire, as well as the control by cooling with fire hoses of the adjacent spaces carried out by crew. 6) Despite it would be useless due to the openings burst out by the explosion in the E/R, it is convenient to point out that the control signal placed in the Bridge for the remote shot of the fixed fire-fighting system (CO2) was interrupted when the electric wires that should transmit the signal were destroyed by the explosion.

Irish nationals. Of the remaining trainees four were Dutch nationals, three were
UK nationals, six were French nationals, two were Belgian nationals and one was
a Spanish national.
On the 24th July it was planned that the ship would be one of the flotilla of
boats taking part in a sailing festival between Oysterhaven and Kinsale.
The ship hauled anchor at 11.00 hrs and proceeded out of Oysterhaven, using
engine power. At about 11.35 hrs sails were being hauled and the course was
altered. Whilst hauling sails the engine was still being used and the ship
proceeded in a SW direction at a speed of approximately 3 knots.
At approximately 11.40 hrs the engine failed and the ship was unable to sail out
of the situation that grounded the ‘Astrid’ on the coast 0.7 NM North West of the

Seeing that the release of steam had died down, the second engineer moved closer to the main steam valve to lift the valve bridge clear from the valve body. 

Suddenly, hot water escaped from the valve housing and spilled over both legs of the second engineer.  As a result of the spill, the second engineer suffered burn injuries, which required hospitalisation. 

The safety investigation found that the immediate cause of the accident was the escape of steam and hot condensate water which had remained entrapped in the system.","Oil Tanker","Serious injuries","57162","American Bureau of Shipping (ABS)","105.472","","24","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","2017-02-23",""

Subsequent dates, the vessel approached to southern out-harbor anchorage on 2nd  July 2013. 
As passing harbor limit of Busan, Master came into bridge at 2000 hours when 3/0, AB &  A/O were in duty in bridge and then proceed to Busan harbor anchorage to drop anchor under  Master’s command. 
At 2030 hours on same date, the vessel passed to Busan VTS limit with her course 356  degrees & her speed 11.5 knots, and reported to VTS center and then was instructed by VTS  to drop anchor at N-4 anchorage upon arrival. 
When the vessel approached to N-4 anchorage at 2100 hours with maneuvering speed &  course, it was found to be too crowded around the N-4 anchorage and Master requested VTS  to re-allocate another anchorage and in turn VTS instructed the vessel to drop anchor N-5  anchorage with keeping 4 cables distance to other vessels. 
Approaching to the N-5 anchorage, the Master ordered to stand by 4 crews, such as C/O,  Bosun, two AB, on forecastle deck for dropping anchor operation and reduced speed at 2103  hours. However when the vessel arrived at N-5 anchorage, the Master found the intended  anchoring position to be also crowded with nearby 4 vessels being too close and encountered  with rough sea, Beaufort scale 6-8b of wind & wave in S’ly direction & poor visibility with  less of 500 meters due to dense fog & drizzle. 
The vessel proceed to find another anchoring position at outer area in N-5 anchorage where is strong current from south, at 2131 hours the VTS urgently instructed the vessel to alter  starboard direction by VHF, however the vessel went aground on rocks of Saeng-Do(Island)  off Yong of Busan at 2137 hours on 2nd  July 2013 at position of Lat. 35-02.14 N & Long. 
129-05.54 E. Before the grounding, the vessel had a draft of 11.0 meters at fore and 11.6 meters at aft. 
At the time of grounding, wind direction was southerly with speed of Beaufort scale 8 and wave direction was southerly with speed of Beaufort scale 7 and visibility was very poor less  of 0.4 miles due to dense fog.   At 2145 hours on 2nd July 2013, the vessel dropped anchor chain to 2 shackles in water and  found double bottom ballast tank to be flood and consequently vessel listed to port side 2  degrees and then at 2155 hours on same date, listed to port side 5 degrees. 
 At 2200 hours on same date, Master reported the situation to VTS center and requested tug boat for rescuing. 
At 0400 hours on 3rd July, some crews except Master, C/E, C/O, 3/O, 1/E, 2/E, Electrician & Motor man (Total 8 crew) were left the vessel.

At the time of the collision, both vessels were in a loaded condition and were inward bound to Singapore to receive bunkers. 

The Atlantic Hero, on passage from Banjarmasin, Indonesia, was approaching the Pilot station from the East in the West bound traffic lane of the Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS). The Oriental Pioneer, on passage from Paranagua Port, Brazil, was approaching the Pilot station from the West and had lined up on a Northerly course that would take her across the West bound traffic lane and place her on the port bow of the Atlantic Hero. 
The collision occurred during the hours of darkness in moderate visibility of approximately 6nm. A light SW breeze was prevailing with a negligible tidal stream.

Although the collision resulted in structural damage to the bow of the Atlantic Hero, the vessel suffered only a minor breach in its watertight integrity. Repairs were conducted in the Singapore Eastern anchorage and the Atlantic Hero was cleared to proceed on passage to Ennore, India at 0500 LT on the 15th July 2013.

As a result of the impact, the Oriental Pioneer suffered a breach in the Starboard side hull plating in way of the Number 1 Fuel Oil tank. Consequently, a pollution incident occurred with approximately 100 MT of Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) spilling into the sea. During the course of the investigation it became evident that a potentially hazardous situation did exist in that two vessels were planned to arrive at the same position at the same time with neither one aware of the others presence until the last moment. This situation was exacerbated with the distraction of a series of confusing multi-recipient VHF transmissions.

With no clear exchange of information in place, time was spent on clarifying these transmissions, in particular the order of Pilot embarkation rather than monitoring the collision situation that was developing and taking appropriate avoiding action.

As a result of that, the vessel was declared total constructive loss on oct/2013. Crew and pilot alleged strong currents at the mouth of the port that drifted the vessel out of the channel. They also alleged a strong visual pollution from port lighting and vessels alongside, that prevented the bridge team from duly observe the port signalling, specially the green light on the outer point of the eastern breakwater. After a full investigation, the report states that the immediate cause was one of the following: - an error in the orders given by the pilor, or - a communication failure between the pilot and the bridge team.

The two sections of the MOL COMFORT are stably floating even under adverse weather. 

Cargo from the broken ship was scattered in the water and oil spilt into the sea.

The crew members abandoned the ship and boarded two life rafts and one lifeboat until they were rescued by MV YANTIAN EXPRESS (being the closest to the scene), which was part of an extensive rescue operation orchestrated by the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre, Mumbai (who sent three ships MV HANJIN BEIJING, MV ZIM INDIA and MV YANTIAN EXPRESS) and the Indian Coast Guard. The rescue operation was conducted in rough weather, the wind force being 30-35 knots.

It is not known what caused the accident.

Update 22 June 2013

According to latest media reports, the majority of the containers are confirmed to be aboard the fore and aft parts of MOL COMFORT, that are drifting near 14”35N 64’50”E and 13’22”N 62’48”E in an east-northeast direction.  The other containers were either lost or damaged.  Still under adverse weather conditions, sections remain afloat and are being monitored by the MV SANDERLING ACE (another MOL managed ship).

A patrol boat, despatched from Jebel Ali is expected to arrive at the scene on Monday 24 June 2013, until the tugboats arrive to tow the two halves of the ship.

The crew members arrived safely in the port of Colombo, Sri Lanka.

A salvage company has been formally contracted to perform the salvage of MOL COMFORT

Investigations into the cause of the incident have commenced.  This is the first case in liner sector when a modern container vessel sank in the ocean after breaking in two parts.  Reports confirm that was no large volume of oil leakage from the accident.

At the time of the incident, the vessel was carrying 91 tonnes of diesel oil on board and a cargo of 2,074 tonnes of timber which were reported as stable and well secured. The Master had stated that although the vessel was ballasted down, she regained buoyancy on the evening rising tide. In fear of losing the ship he decided that the safest option for his crew was to allow the vessel to move clear of the shore. During the course of the day a number of salvage companies were mobilised to the area to carry out damage assessments. Class, MAIB and MCA were on scene. 

At this stage the vessel was reported as stable, with all engines fully operational. Temporary repairs were carried out by the crew in reducing water ingress. The ship later re-floated with minor assistance from Tobermory lifeboat and proceeded safely to anchorage at Salen Bay, Sound of Mull at 23:50 BST where the vessel remained overnight. The following morning (15/6), 'FRI OCEAN' proceeded to a second anchorage off Oban to undergo underwater inspection, Class Inspection and Port State Control. During Class inspection of the vessel it was revealed that the emergency fire pump piping had been damaged during the grounding. Damages also reported in the bow thruster compartment along with breaches in the void space and forepeak area. The breaches in the void space below the bow thrust and in the forepeak were controlled by bilge pumps and each compartment was sealed.

At the time of the accident, the pilot boat had just transferred a pilot to the ship, inbound for Marsaxlokk port, Malta.
 
The safety investigation focused mainly on the operating procedures and practices on board the pilot boat and its personnel as well as the pilot boarding arrangement on OS Bodrum.  These findings were then analysed in the light of regulatory requirements and established industry safe practices in order to draw conclusions and to make safety recommendations. 

Amongst other factors, this safety investigation established that the pilot boarding arrangement provided by the ship was not compliant with the relevant SOLAS requirements due to its close proximity to the ship’s stern and overhang and therefore was intrinsically dangerous.  Moreover, the pilot and the deckhand did not follow the industry’s recommended practice to walk on the outboard side of the pilot boat.","Other Activities Ships","Serious injuries","6.67","","","","2","0","2","0","0","0","1","0","0","2017-01-27",""

The crew had been given a verbal message from the shipping company not to sail through Fyrsundet sound until further notice, as the aft mast was assumed to be too high for MF Røst to pass under the overhead high-voltage cables. However, the captain and chief mate on duty at the time of the accident believed that it would be possible for MF Røst to pass under the cables. On 18 May 2013, they therefore intended to verify the distance between the vessel's aft mast and the overhead cables. The nautical chart showed a safe vertical clearance of 20 metres, while the signs ashore showed 22 metres. The shipboard management had measured the vessels air draft to be 20,7 metres from the water line to the top of the aft mast. On reaching Fyrsundet, the chief mate climbed up the foremast, that was slighly lower than the aft mast, to observe the passage and to check the margin between the mast and the cables using a fishingrod that he had taken with him. However, as the vessel passed under the least of the three high-voltage cables, the fishingrod came in contact with high-voltage, the chief mate received an electric shock and died as a consequence of falling down from the foremast.
The AIBN investigation found that the information flow in the shipping company was inadequate, that there was a lack of routines in the authorities reporting of chart data and continous updating of navigational charts, and that the crew was not familiar with the requirement for a safety margin in relation to overhead cables carrying high-voltage. The AIBN proposes forur safety reccomendations as a result of the investigation.","Passenger / Ro-Ro Cargo Ship","","2053","[Other]","779","","8","2","0","","","","","","","2017-11-29",""

He did not survive the injuries sustained. Tyrusland was berthed in Tripoli and the crew were working with an embarked team	of	vehicle	drivers	to	discharge	a	cargo	of	containers.		AB	Penafiel’s	role	was	to release and remove twistlocks during the cargo discharge operation.  This task required him to work in close proximity to moving vehicles that were being used to handle the containers. At the time of the accident, a full container was being handled using a fork-lift truck.  The fork-lift truck driver was conducting a manoeuvre to avoid the container striking an adjacent stack of containers and to realign the container in preparation for loading	it	onto	a	waiting	trailer.		However,	the	driver	could	not	see	AB	Penafiel	and	was,	therefore,	unaware	of	his	movements.		As	AB	Penafiel	attempted	to	remove	a	twistlock from the deck, the moving container collided with a static container, fatally crushing him in between. The MAIB investigation found that the system of work employed by those involved in	the	cargo	handling	process	was	unsafe	and	that	AB	Penafiel	had	entered	a	hazardous	area	with	insufficient	safeguards	in	place.		The investigation also found that there were weaknesses in the implementation of the company’s safety management system (SMS) on board Tyrusland, particularly relating to risk assessments and SMS review processes.  Although a risk assessment relating to working on deck existed, it did not identify and address the specific	hazard	of	a	worker	being	crushed	by	a	moving	vehicle	or	container	during	cargo handling operations.  The lack of appropriate risk assessments was an issue	that	had	been	identified	previously	in	both	an	internal	company	audit	and	an	external audit conducted by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA).  However, follow-up action by the company and the MCA in response to this issue was insufficient	to	prevent	the	accident.	This was the fourth accident, two of which were fatal, in less than a year involving UK	flagged	ships	managed	by	Imperial	Ship	Management	AB.		The	company	has since conducted a safety management review and has developed a plan for improving	procedures	and	safety	culture	across	its	fleet.		The	MAIB	has	previously	made a recommendation1 to the MCA aimed at improving its processes for managing audits and follow-up action. In view of this recommendation and the action taken since by Imperial Ship Management, no recommendations are made in this report.

The sea was calm and visibility good. Both ships were heading for Bremerhaven and had previously followed the course of the fairway under pilotage.
The collision happened during an overtaking manoeuvre by the Conmar Avenue, during which technical problems occurred with the supply of lubricating oil to the course of the day. However, this time it was not possible to remedy the difficulties at short notice. Therefore, the engine shut down automatically to prevent serious damage. As a result, the Conmar Avenue lost manoeuvrability and was drawn into the wake of much larger Maersk Kalmar. Despite contra-rudder, she then turned towards the Maersk Kalmar due to hydrodynamic interactions. The Conmar Avenue’s forecastle rammed into the Starboard side of the Maersk Kalmar’s aft section at an angle of about 60 degrees. The force of the collision caused 15 containers on the Conmar Avenue to fall overboard. Both ships sustained material damage above the waterline. The accident did not result in any injuries and there was no pollution of any significance. The fairway had to be temporarily closed to transiting shipping.
The Maersk Kalmar was able to continue her voyage to Bremerhaven under her own steam. Due to the ebb current and her loss of manoeuvrability, the Conmar Avenue ran aground outside the fairway level with buoy 30 after the collision. She anchored there and was pulled back into the fairway at about 18:30 with the help of five tugs. After that, this ship initially continued her own steam, too. At about 19:41 hrs, technical problems with the supply of lubricating oil were experienced again shortly before reaching the port boundary in the area of buoy 45, however. Following that, the precaution was taken to designate the Conmar Avenue a ship not under command. She was towed to the berth by tugs and made fast there at 21:05 hrs.

On 29 April 2013, while the chief mate was standing the 04-08 navigational watch, the vessel collided with the 133 m long general cargo vessel Pirireis approaching on a nearly reciprocal course but clear on her starboard side. At the time of the collision it was still dark, the weather was calm and clear with little variable winds of force 2 and a seastate 1.
On M/V Consouth both radars were in operation and the vessel’s steering was in autopilot mode. No lookout was posted. The OOW had noticed the approaching Pirireis well in advance. After he evaluated ARPA readings, the CPA showed to being not less than 0,8 nm on starboard side, thus both vessels should have passed green to green in a safe distance. Once having almost reached the CPA the OOW on Consouth suddenly saw Pirireis turning to starboard showing her port side with the red light rapidly approaching in a crossing situation. The collision could not be avoided.

Consouth penetrated heavily into Pirireis’ aft port quarter.
Pirireis sunk rapidly. Seven of her 17 crew survived, two dead seafarers could be retrieved and eight remained missing.

Other than the obligation of a flag State to conduct a marine safety investigation into a very serious marine casualty it is the aim of the flag State to identify why a standard traffic situation at sea with two vessels encountering each other in darkness in good weather conditions could escalate into a deadly collision.","Container Ship (Fully Cellular)","Loss of life,Ship remains fit to proceed","7171","Germanischer Lloyd (GL)","8904","General cargo, break-bulk, containers, may include IMDG cargo","16","","","10","","","","","","2014-01-10","2016-08-11"

Unexpectedly, the ship slammed into a very large wave.  For a short moment, the seas that were shipped and the dense sea spray obscured the bow from the bridge.  The master was exposed to the violent impact of the breaking wave.  As the water washed over the bow, the master was tossed away from the forecastle deck to the catwalk. 

It is highly probable that in so doing, the master hit violently against the hydraulic manifold block of the port windlass and sustained fatal injuries. 

The investigation concluded that the decision-making structure, the risk assessment and mitigation processes leading to the attempted operation were amongst the main contributors to this fatal accident.","Oil Tanker","","4829","Bureau Veritas (BV)","6970","","15","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","2017-01-27",""

The rudder unexpectedly remained at hard to port just a few minutes after casting off the lines. Immediate use of the tiller made it possible to regain control of the ship.
The chief and the electrician searched extensively for the fault for several minutes, but did not find it.
The steering gear suddenly returned to normal and the voyage was continued . The two individuals remained in the steering gear compartment as a precaution. The Norfolk Express accelerated to 18kts and proceeded down the River Weser. At 09:31 hrs failed again and the rudder remained and sailed towards the Landgütjen breakwater in a wide arc. The engine was stopped and the port anchor dropped. Despite that, the ship continued to move forward with her bulbous bow ramming against the dam and only came to a standstill there. The damage to the Norfolk express was so severe that she laid up for repairs in dry dock for weeks. Fortunately, there were neither injuries nor environmental damage.

The sailor on watch was on his own on the bridge, steering manually. The heading was  varying from 070° to 075° and the speed was around 3 knots. The two all-round red lights of a  vessel not under command were exhibited, as well as the underway vessel lights, the fishing  lights and the ship’s deck lights.  
The sailor on watch aboard LOÏC-LUCAS saw on the radar display a vessel in the  vicinity and thought she would alter course.  At the same time, and in the same area, the Dutch cargo vessel AMBASSADEUR was  heading 074° at about 9 knots. The master was on his own on the bridge and the vessels in the vicinity (except for LOÏC-LUCAS) were processed by the Radar anti-collision system (range 12  miles) and by the AIS. A TV program (or a DVD film) was being played on the bridge. 
 Soon after midnight LOÏC-LUCAS made an DSC distress call received by Jobourg and  Gris-Nez MRCC. However, during the first minutes of the operation, only Gris-Nez MRCC could  manage to communicate (by VHF on channel 16) with the LOÏC-LUCAS’s skipper. The latter  explained that she had just been collided by a cargo vessel; within one minute, she precised that  she was the cargo vessel AMBASSADEUR and transmitted her position. A major water leak in the  steering room was observed by LOÏC-LUCAS’ engineer.  
Less than five minutes after LOÏC-LUCAS’ first call, the master of AMBASSADEUR  modified the radar range (6 miles) for a while, then he has been plotting the blip of a small  vessel located 1 mile on his stern. This operation had been repeated several times, while  AMBASSADEUR was sailing away without reducing speed or altering course. The radar drop down  menu shows that the operator had done an identification search. 

 Fifteen minutes after the presumed collision between these two vessels, Gris-Nez  Traffic contacted AMBASSADEUR and informed her of the situation. The master declared that he  was surprised, then AMBASSADEUR made a U-turn and headed to LOÏC-LUCAS’ position. Two  fishing vessels had been also called up by Jobourg MRCC. 
 
When the LOÏC-LUCAS’ crew was out of danger, AMBASSADEUR resumed her voyage to  Moerdijk (Pays-Bas). LOÏC-LUCAS would sink soon after in 56 meters deep waters.

ENGLISH VERSION:
On 27 March, at 2:28 PM, under good visibility and weather conditions, the Liberian bulk carrier ""Vega Taurus"", of 33,044 GRT, 190 meters length and 11.6 meters draft, loaded with 34,174 tons of copper, was navigating from North to South through the Gray channel, bound to India.
Due to circumstances that are currently under investigation, the ship altered its course and hit bottom at Bajo Connor. As a result, the rudder and the propeller were damaged, a tank started leaking, and the hull resulted deformed on the starboard side. The ship anchored on a nearby site, and remained unable to navigate under its own power. 
There were no injuries to the crew, nor damage to the marine environment caused by the grounding.

The crew was made of eight sailors and one engineer from the LORIMA Company, which built the mast.

On 27 March the passage of a weak squall line was forecast. During the watch from noon to 1.30 pm, the weather worsened with showers. Mousetrap was sailing then at about 13 knots with one reef in the mainsail and solent, at 70° from the apparent wind.

Soon after the end of the squall, the female lookout on watch went down to the accommodation deck to inform the captain that the wind was blowing at more than 30 knots. She had just resumed her task when the mast broke out in three parts; she had barely had time to lay down on the flybridge to protect herself. But the helmsman had been crushed by the main shroud against the steering console. All the efforts of the crew to revive him had been in vain.

 The complete rigging comprising the mast, the cables and the sails had been abandoned to sea and sank. After some checking and repairs, she sailed back under power to her port of departure where she arrived on 30 March.","Other Activities Ships","Loss of life,Ship remains fit to proceed","234","","","","9","0","0","1","","","0","","","2015-05-29",""

In order to manage the pressure, he tried to open a valve to evacuate the water towards the bilge. The pressure pushed the bonnet of this valve out of position, freeing steam. The engineer was heavily burnt on the right arm. French MRCC Boulogne was informed.

The ship was in the mooring process and the crew had given out all the mooring lines. Due mostly to the swell in the port area, the vessel was about 1m ahead of the proper position for the passenger gangway to be connected to the dock, so she had to be moved aftwards. The engines were already stopped, so the move was to be carried out by heaving one of the two bow spring lines (the second one had been connected to the bind but not heaved) and slacking the stern lines. 
After the ship moved in this way aftwards and was in the right position, the stern lines were also heaved and preparations began so the second bow spring line would be heaved too. The whole procedure was to be carried out by the bow mooring deck crew, which comprised of 6 A/Bs and a second officer. The second officer with an A/B were standing on a convertible mooring platform when the first (tightened) spring line broke, hitting the A/B on the platform and throwing him on the platform's rail and then overboard.
Hellenic Coast Guard members on the dock saw the accident and dived in the sea to help the A/B. However he sank at once and could not be retrieved by the HCGs. The ship moored with another line and about two hours later, divers from the HCG came to the port and found the body of the A/B in the sea bed below the ship. 
Investigation was carried out by HBMCI.","Passenger Ship","Loss of life,Ship remains fit to proceed","93558","[Other]","","","1021","2487","","1","","","","","","2015-08-31","2016-08-11"

That morning, at 7 o'clock, the vessel commenced a voyage between SAN SEBASTIAN (GOMERA) and LOS CRISTIANOS (Tenerife). Hereafter, Company had scheduled more voyages among previous ports and some others like LA ESTACA (HIERRO) and SANTA CRUZ (LA PALMA). The vessel was completing the scheduled voyages without any setback despite the fact that weather and sea conditions were worsening as day drew on. Weather forecasts had anticipated such conditions, and local Government authorities had even declared special warnings for heavy weather conditions, based in the National Agency of Meteorology (AEMET) reports. On 14:28 h, after finishing cargo operations the HSC BENCHIJIGUA EXPRESS departed from LOS CRISTIANOS (TENERIFE) bound to SANTA CRUZ (LA PALMA), with a layover in SAN SEBASTIAN (GOMERA). The craft was carrying 511 passengers, 61 vehicles and 101 mT of cargo for SAN SEBASTIAN, and 157 passengers, 43 vehicles and 103 mT of cargo for SANTACRUZ. According log-book records, the craft arrived to SAN SEBASTIAN at 15:19 h. Here additional 20 passengers, 7 vehicles and 8 mT of cargo were embarked. Vessel departed at 15:40 h. Later on, at 15:55 h the vessel slowed her speed due to adverse sea conditions. At 17:30 h the craft stopped 7 miles off SANTA CRUZ , awaiting instructins, due to adverse conditions inside the port. 15' later, the Master was advised by the Pilot of SANTA CRUZ (LA PALMA) that the port was closed. Then, the Company instructed the vessel to proceed to SAN SEBASTIAN (GOMERA). At 20:03 h, vessel slowed down her engines to approach the port. Nevertheless, the vessel could not initiate any manoeuver until 20:35 h as visibility was poor. At 20:45 h the craft could make fast to the pier but the ramps could not be opened due to the rough water breaking against the it. So, the craft did not get to operate in this port. At 21:05 h the craft departed from this port and, following instructions fron the Company, went to SANTA CRUZ DE TENERIFE, reaching this por next day (March 4th) at 00:24h. During related journeys, and specially since the craft departed from SAN SEBASTIAN (GOMERA) at 15:40 h up to her berthing in SANTA CRUZ DE TENERIFE next day at 00:24 h (8 hours and 44 minutes) the vessel supported the pounding and battering of waves as well as heavy rolling and pitching movements that even forced crew to slow down engines and/or alter her course in order to avoid or diminish posible damages. Several passengers considered that they were put into a risk/danger position and have expressed their uneasiness with claims and sues against all parts concerned. CIAIM has received a formal claim and has decided to complete a full investigation on that. Current report exclusively keeps within safety issues regarding the voyages made by the HSC BENCHIJIGUA EXPRESS such day, and it do not evaluate any lack of comfort suffered by the passengers during those near 9 hours because of heavy weather. CONCLUSIONS OF INVESTIGATION 1) The ship EXPRESS BENCHIJIGUA was not subject to unacceptable risks for sailings that made the day March 3, 2013. 2) The ship's crew BENCHIJIGUA EXPRESS took appropriate from the point of view of safety of navigation decisions. 3) Difficulties encountered the ship from leaving the port of San Sebastin de La Gomera were because: a. Limitations to operate the port of Santa Cruz de La Palma found to be lower than the limitations of the ship to sail as a result the ship was found in nearby weather its boundary conditions without access to port. b. The closure of the port of Santa Cruz de La Palma was not foresaw in good time so that the master Benchijigua Express could suspend service. RECOMMENDATIONS To the Port authorities of Canary Islands 1) To adopt procedures documented in coordination with the Directorate General of Security and Emergency of Canarias on closing ports of their competence in general and inter-island passenger traffic in particular when the unfavorable weather forecasts along with the accumulated experience of the impact of these predictions in each port parties advise total or partial closure of the port. These procedures should take into account the type of vessels in these trades, their schedules and their operational limitations. The procedures should provide for the closure in good time so that they can inform shippers that these vessels do not depart to sea without a clear anticipation to such closure of their destination ports. To the shipping company 2) Improve matters relating to the information transmitted to the passage when bad weather is expected during the passage. 3) Include in the process of trip cancellation of Companys Safety Management System, as a main reference, the approved Exploitation Permit for Ship. It would also include a convenient tool aid to decision making.","Passenger / Ro-Ro Cargo Ship","Ship remains fit to proceed","8973","[Other]","","Roll-on/Roll-off","25","177","","","","","","","","2019-10-25",""

The HERM KIEPE waited in the siding to enter the Große Nordschleuse (large north lock). The eastbound CREMONA and behind her the EMPIRE were located in the Große Nordschleuse. The KLENODEN, also eastbound, was located in the Kleine Nordschleuse (small north lock). The CREMONA left the locks first, then the KLENODEN, and finally the EMPIRE. The CREMONA passed the HERM KIEPE at an estimated distance of 30 m, while the KLENODEN proceeded further to the south. It is likely that hydrodynamic interaction occurred between the ships during both encounters. The HERM KIEPE made turning movements towards the middle of the canal. The EMPIRE, which was following, proceeded from the guiding racks to the siding's berth about 500 m away just north of the middle of the fairway. In the process, her port side collided with the bow of the HERM KIEPE and she lost four containers. One container landed on the forecastle of the HERM KIEPE. A pilot and two canal helmsmen manned each ship. There were no injuries and no pollutants escaped during the accident. The canal was closed and floating/submerged containers were located and secured.

After a 30 minute voyage AGIOS DIONISIOS arrived at the mussel plant area and begun heaving the mussels for cleaning and replacing the protective net. At approximately 11:00am AGIOS DIONISIOS suddenly begun to list on her port and aft side. In response to the dangerous situation, skipper and the workers attempted to shift the mussel cargo which was on deck to the fore and starboard side but their effort was unfruitful. The list kept increasing until AGIOS DIONISIOS capsized and sunk. Skipper and the three persons fell overboard and managed to hang on to the mussel plants buoys until they were recovered by a fishing boat sailing near the area. AGIOS DIONISIOS was refloated the following day and after necessary repairs continued to be operational. Safety issues and contributing factors identified by HBMCIs safety investigation are summarized below: 1. Openings at the aft part of the deck and flat part of the stern, allowed sea water to enter and accumulate inside the engine room space. 2. Water accumulation was not observed by the skipper. 3.

When tender boat/lifeboat no. 10 (tender boat no. 10) was extended, and before lowering it, the forward wire rope fall parted, causing the tender boat to swivel on the aft hook.  The tender boat remained hanging by the aft hook, which then ripped off its base, causing the boat to fall in the water, bow first, at an approximate angle of 45° and a height of 15 m. 

The tender boat remained afloat upright.  The fall caused damage to the tender boat’s hull and upper structure.  Subsequently, it was boarded by engineers and all fuel tanks were isolated.  No flooding occurred and no oil spills were reported.  A second ship’s tender boat was used to tow the damaged tender boat ashore.  As a precautionary measure, an oil boom was deployed around the damaged tender boat.  A third tender boat was used to retrieve the floating equipment and life jackets in the water that fell from tender boat no. 10.  At the time of the accident, no crew members were inside tender boat no. 10 and no injuries occurred. 

The safety investigation found that: 
the wire rope had parted at a site of severe pre-existing corrosion wastage, which reduced the wire rope’s cross-section and load carrying capacity; 
it required Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) analysis to determine that the wire rope’s crowns exhibited severe corrosion attack representing as much as 50% reduction in its cross-section.  Therefore, a change in the internal cross-section of the wire rope would not have been evident by visual examination such as that performed by either the ship’s crew or the contracted external technicians; 
the laboratory analysis of the grease from the failed wire rope revealed that it was contaminated with high concentrations of the elemental components of sea water as well as metals, including iron and zinc, thus precluding it from serving as an anti-corrosive protection; 
the extensive corrosion of the failed wire rope was due to lack of adequate anti-corrosive protection sometime during its life.  The corrosion could have either initiated shortly after manufacture due to lack of grease, or as a result of insufficient grease, premature loss of grease, and/or loss of grease protective properties during its service life; 
the Company had prepared processes for ordering, supplying, maintaining and inspecting the wire ropes; however, they were not integrated as an overall safety system to manage the long term integrity of the wire ropes.","Passenger Ship","Ship remains fit to proceed","72458","Lloyd's Register (LR)","7260","","850","1780","0","","","","","","","2017-01-27",""

The weather conditions were good and the procedure would be assisted by T/B ARTEMIS V which received a towing line from the aft port quarter of JSM. No Port pilot was available and as a result the whole procedure was planned exclusively by the Master of the ship. JSM cast off her starboard bow from the pier handling her aft spring line and according to the plan stern would be cleared by the towing (pulling) of the T/B. However, according to the master of JSM, tug's maneuver was carried out with engine power applied more than expected and as a result the distance between JSM4s stern and the dock became greater than the distance between her bow and the dock rendering ship's heading towards port exit hazardous and posing a risk of grounding or impacting on the breakwater of the fishing shelter inside Kiato Port. The maneuvering of JSM in order to avoid the dangerous situation and since ARTEMIS V did not release the towline, resulted in the progressive heeling over of the tug to starboard and in rapid foundering. JSM continued her maneuver and exited the port entrance after receiving her towline which was released from the hook of ARTEMIS V due to buoyancy. Two crew members of the Tug out of three abandoned her (Engineer and deck rating) while she was heeling over to starboard and were rescued. Following the foundering the Skipper was emerged on sea surface but lost his consciousness and shortly after it was determined he had died. According to the postmortem examination conducted on 05 April 2013 by the Forensic Service of Patras it was determined that the cause of his death was due to drowning by seawater.","Towing / Pushing Tug","Ship rendered unfit to proceed","54.4","","","","3","","","","","","","","","2019-07-23",""

The navigational officer of the watch noticed the activation of the engine-room fire alarm and immediately phoned the engine control room to alert the engineering officer of the watch.  The engineers took immediate action and confirmed that auxiliary engine no. 1 was on fire. 

Due to the intensity of the fire and the dense smoke, attempts to extinguish the fire with two portable fire extinguishers proved futile. 

Consequently, the engine-room had to be abandoned. 

The fire was eventually brought under control and extinguished after the activation of the fixed CO2 installation.

The position was close to the Northwest entrance of the TSS North of Rugen in the Baltic Sea. 

Preliminary information indicated that the collision occurred when Katre was proceeding on a South-easterly course close to the Northwest entrance of the TSS North of Rugen.  Statengracht was proceeding towards the entrance of the TSS North of Rugen on a Westerly course. 

Statengracht sustained damages to her port side in way of cargo hold no. 2.  As a result of the damage, she developed a port list of about 10°.  Statengracht was instructed to proceed to the port of Rostock, Germany, which was her original destination.  Katre, which sustained damages to her bow area, was instructed to proceed to the port of Mukran, Germany.  No injuries and no pollution were reported from both vessels.

The leakage was caused by a mechanical break-down of a stern thruster situated at the aft part of the ship’s shaft tunnel whereby the shaft tunnel was flooded. The bulkhead between the shaft tunnel and the main engine room could not withstand the hydrostatic water pressure and eventually the main engine room was also flooded.
 
The situation became complicated because the ship had just initiated a passage in a convoy through the Suez Canal. Loss of the ship’s own propulsion, electric power, steerage and ma-noeuvrability could be foreseen and eventually occurred.

The main technical sequence of events were a break-down of the forward stern thruster causing a major leakage into the shaft tunnel, a collapse of the watertight integrity of the bulkhead between the shaft tunnel and the engine room, primarily caused by non-effective cable penetration sealings and some undesirable properties of the bilge system and the emergency bilge suction from the engine room. Throughout the course of events, all officers and crew members were constantly disturbed and highly stressed by the sound of countless alarms, which made it extremely difficult to concentrate on the many challenges that ap-peared.

Despite a series of technical breakdowns and system weaknesses, the shipboard organization remained resilient, and despite the breakdown of the structural barriers, the ship’s officers and crew managed to contain the emergency situation and bring the ship alongside at the Suez Canal Container Terminal without any personal injury or pollution to the environment.
 
The report contains information about the preventive measures taken by the shipping com-pany, the classification society and other parties involved. The report contains no safety rec-ommendations from the Danish Maritime Accident Investigation Board.

The Panama-flagged bulk carrier Coral Ace had discharged coal in the port of Nordenham on the previous day and then set her anchor in the roadstead. The Cyprus-flagged container ship Lisa Schulte had already been laid up there at anchor for almost a week in ballast. The Coral Ace anchored at a distance of about 7 cbl to the west of the Lisa Schulte.
In the area of the German Bight, the wind picked up from midday of 30 January 2013 and was generally strong to gale force from the south-west. The gusts increased slightly in the evening and the wing veered towards the west. At 18:00 hrs, the navigational warnings included a gale warning for the German Bight predicting 8 to 9 Bft.
After midnight, the Coral Ace started to drift towards the Lisa Schulte. Gusts of between 41 and 54 kts, equivalent to 9 ot 10 Bfts, were registered in the area of the roadstead. Significant wave height stood at 4 to 5 m with single waves possibly reaching g 7 m. Visibility was between 5 and 10 km.
The officer on watch on the Lisa Schulte called his counterpart on the Coral Ace on VHF when he noticed that her anchor was not holding her in position any more. The OOW on the Coral Ace promised to arrange for the engine to be started. As opposed to that of the Lisa Schulte, the Coral Ace’s engine was not on standby. The distance between the two ships had already dropped to 3 cbl. The Coral Ace was parallel to the sea, about 90° to the wind, and rolling heavily. The collision occurred shortly afterwards.
Nobody came to physical harm. Water ingress occurred on both ships. Buoyancy was not adversely affected by this and there was no water pollution. The water pollution control ship Mellum was ordered to proceed to the casualty ships. It was not possible to take action at the scene because of the weather. As events unfolded, the German Central Command for Maritime Emergencies assumed overall control of the operation.
Escorted by the Mellum, the Coral Ace moved to the Südwestkai in Wilhelmshaven. The Lisa Schulte moved to the Voslapp-roadstead.

At the end of the morning she was wind aft – 10 to 15° from the centerline on the port stern. The wind freshened suddenly and strongly while the cargo work was to begin after a short situation assessment by the master, the first officer and the ship’s agent (Dee Marine).
As the stern of the ship was moving increasingly, the master called to manoeuvring stations. Soon after the stern lines gave way, then the fore lines a couple of minutes after the main engines and bow have begun to operate.
Then began a real battle against the elements, wind and tide, to control the drift of the ship and to try to move her upwind. In vain, the ship eventually grounded on the sand and mud shoal located in the north-ease of the turning area.
Taking advantage of a high spring tide ten days later, she has been refloated without any hull damage.

At the time of the accident, the ship's crew were participating in a routine drill and exercise entailing the simulated rescue of a crew member from within an enclosed space. As part of the exercise, the Bosun and Third officer were assigned duties inside No 4 port ballast tank to prepare the simulated casualty, in this case a dummy, for stretcher evacuation. 

Once the drill briefing had been conducted with the Chief Officer, the Bosun and Third officer entered the tank and successfully managed to locate the simulated casualty on the first stringer platform. 

With a number of openings in the deck plating and no guard rails or fall barriers in place to protect the crew members involved, this platform presented a serious risk to the planned operation. 

Whilst attempting to secure the dummy on to the ship's stretcher, the Bosun fell backwards into an opening in the platform plating. 

The investigation found that the tank had been prepared and well ventilated, both naturally and forced, to enable an internal inspection of the space earlier that morning. The atmosphere had also been tested by the Chief Officer using a calibrated test meter both before and during the course of the exercise and was found to be suitable for entry. 

A risk assessment had been completed for the planned entry into the ballast tank which identified that the height of the tank stringer platforms posed a hazard to safety. the use of a safety harness was therefore implemented as the most appropriate control measure to prevent injury. At the time of the accident, during the enclosed space rescue exercise however, neither the Bosun or Third Officer was wearing a safety harness. 

The ordinary practice on board for enclosed space rescue exercises was to conduct them within a juice tank void where working platforms are much larger. A secondary risk assessment had therefore not been completed for the planned emergency drill within this ballast tank space.

He struck on one of the wood trunks and felt into a lower position between a wood bale and the portside bulwark.  This casualty is considered a serious one, notwithstanding the fact that it had resulted to the extended immobilization of the injured person caused by the high fall, it had provoked the extended immobilization of the injured person. The conclusions of the investigation had been:
a) The worker wearied the PPE recommended and provided by his employer by march 2012 (working suit, foot-wear, helmet, gloves);The victim was not subjected to an occupation that implied an excessive fatigue state;
b)  The surface over where the onboard stevedores had to move, was specially irregular and slippery. The risk would be increased by the fact that it had a vegetal nature and was wet;
c) Despite of the fact of the outer sole of the working boot was a non-slippery one, it was not specially adapted to an irregular surface with a high risk of slippery.
d) By not having a OSH service in the company, the internal weighting of the risks posed by different ships types of cargo operating and environmental conditions is not performed in a systematic, continuous and objective way, but is rather considered generically.","General Cargo Ship","","2545","Germanischer Lloyd (GL)","3813","","","0","0","","","","","","","2017-01-23",""

The skipper was fixing their position with a plotter. The night was clear and visibility good. He realised that a lateral sector light (green and yellow) that was fitted on a a shoal called As Carrallas, was shut. But he remained sailing with the information given by the plotter. Unexpectedly they felt a hit. The boat run aground and they could not release the boat starting the motor ahead and astern. The skipper realised that the boat was 50 m closer to shoal than the expected position.The skipper requested assistance by VHF ch. 16 and both crew were rescued by a helicopter.Maritime authorities decided to put salvage operations off till next day with daylight. During the night the vessel sunk close to the aground point. The next days efforts were made to recover the shipwreck, with no result.CONCLUSIONS The skipper based navigation in only one positioning means, the plotter, without apparently concern when he didn't see, where should be, the green light of Punta Castrelius beacon. This should make him suspicious and force him to make sure his position by other means.At no time navigation was contrasted with a second positioning method among those which were available for a traditional coastal shipping, as it had been monitoring bearings and markings to the relevant lights of the coast or the more accessible ble and immediate, the search for the leading line offered by the lights of Punta Arroyo, which would have allowed him to pass safely through the beacon of Punta Castrelius, nevermind if it was switched on or off.The plotter had an error in the position accuracy, that the same skipper quantified in 50 m. This fact, and assuming that the beacon of Punta Castrelius operated normally, suggests that the skipper sailed by one of the shaded light beacon areas, which was the reason that the skipper did not see the light until time of stranding.After examining the available images of the event, it appears that the vessel ran aground in the shadow of the beacon (see Figure 3 on the Report), so that the skipper still did not see its light during emergency until he was rescued.From the above it is concluded that the skipper did not follow good practices required to a navigator, especially when it comes to maintain an effective surveillance using all available means appropriate to the circumstances and conditions of the moment. This action can be identified as a planning error committed by the skipper, driven by overconfidence and low perception of risk associated with his good knowledge of the environment.RECOMMENDATIONSAfter investigation the CIAIM does not formulate any recommendation.","Fish Catching Vessel","Pollution,Ship rendered unfit to proceed","3.69","","","","2","0","","","","","","","","2019-10-25",""

No injuries and / or pollution were reported.
 
Following the accident, the laboratory analysis after destructive and non-destructive testing of the three point lifting sling concluded that the material used for stitching the lifting sling splice had failed during the launching of the boat.  The tests further concluded that the stitching material had degraded along one side of the lifting sling for almost its entire length.  The weakening and eventual failure of the stitches was attributed to age, wear and tear, and exposure to Ultra Violet (UV) and the harsh elements of the sea.","Chemical Tanker","Ship remains fit to proceed","5744","DNV AS (DNV)","8110","Liquid cargo - Chemicals","18","0","0","","","","","","","2017-02-23",""

The accident involved a brake failure on one of the lifeboat’s winches during a routine abandon ship drill. 

At 1055 of 06 January 2013, the master announced an abandon ship drill.  The weather was clear with a light to fresh breeze.  He decided to combine the drill with the weekly lifeboat inspection. This involved swinging the lifeboats out from their stowed position without crew.  The crew mustered at their designated boat stations.  First, lifeboat no. 2 (port side) was swung out and re- stowed.  Then, at 1118, lifeboat no. 1 (starboard side) was swung out by pulling the remote control brake handle on the boat deck.  When outboard and clear of the davits, the remote control brake handle was released to stop the movement.  However, the wire falls continued to run out.  Efforts to arrest the descent of the lifeboat by pushing down on the winch brake handle were unsuccessful. The downward movement continued until the lifeboat hit the sea.  At the time, the ship was underway making 11 knots. 

As a result of the impact, the lifeboat door opened and water started flooding inside.  The starboard lifeboat started to list.  In the meantime, the master slowed down the main engine.  Shortly afterwards, the forward on- load release gear opened and the painter parted.  The lifeboat held by the aft wire falls was pushed further away by the motion of the vessel.  A line from the aft mooring winch was passed and the lifeboat was hauled-in under the davits.  However, the pounding and pitching of the lifeboat caused the wire falls to slack, resulting in the release of the remaining on-load hook mechanism.  The lifeboat was now adrift and floating free. 

The vessel was turned around to recover the lifeboat.  After several attempts, the lifeboat was brought alongside and at 1405, it was finally hoisted up with the ship’s cargo cranes and secured on deck. 

The safety investigation identified poor condition of a ball bearing inside the winch as the immediate contributing factor to the uncontrolled descent of lifeboat no. 1 during the routine abandon ship drill at sea.","Bulk Dry (general, ore) Carrier","Ship remains fit to proceed","17928","Bureau Veritas (BV)","28373","Solid cargo - Dry bulk","21","0","0","","","","","","","2017-01-27",""

The tug flood and sunk after few minutes. No crew were onboard NOVO JUNDI A. CONCLUSIONS 1. The collision between the service boat COS OTERO and the F/V NOVO JUNDI A was caused by an excess of confidence on the part of the E/T COS OTERO skipper and by the lack of human and technical resources available to him to carry out the unhooking, towing and mooring manoeuvres of the fishing boat. 2. The CIAIM considers that the described service, which included undocking, towing and mooring manoeuvres of a vessel of the size of the aforementioned fishing vessel in the port of A Coru a, constituted a practice that involved risks, whose control should have not be left to the discretion of the participants in the activity, and should be regulated by the competent administrations.","Towing / Pushing Tug","Pollution,Ship rendered unfit to proceed","","","","","1","0","0","","","","","","","2019-10-25",""
