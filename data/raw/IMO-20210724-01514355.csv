Soon after leaving Belfast the main engine temperatures started to steadily increase.   The oil pressure dropped and it was noticed that there was an increase in the engine oil level.

Tests of the oil confirmed that it had become water contaminated.  The problem was located on a cylinder head and water was seen to transfer to the head valve operating gear into the sump.  The Chief Engineer advised the captain to come immediately to anchor, but the harbour authorities objected because of the frequent fast ferry service.  The vessel was taken further out from the harbour, but the engineer became increasingly concerned about the oil contamination and firmly advised the master to anchor or else risk the engine being written off.  By now the vessel was about 3.5 cables from a pipeline - the captain decided that it was safe to anchor.  After doing so the engineers removed the affected cylinder head and found blanking and locating screws loose.  The cylinder head had been subjected to the manufacturer's overhaul and had only been fitted 2 weeks previously.

While the repairs were being undertaken SOSREP was informed and decided that in light of the weather conditions and the potential risk to the pipeline,  the vessel should be towed into Belfast.  The vessel arrived alongside about 7 hours later.  Repairs were completed by the crew while alongside, and the oil change completed.","GENERAL CARGO","Ship rendered unfit to proceed","2260","Germanischer Lloyd (GL)","3418","Road salt","6","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","",""

The weather throughout the day had been strong Westerly gale force winds, increasing in strength. At the time of the initial incident winds force 10 were experienced along with large sea / swells.
Although the passage had been easy, with sea and swell coming from astern, as Riverdance approached the Lune Deep buoy she began to roll. Initially two trailers were reported to have shifted before the rolling died down. As the trailer shift was being investigated the rolling started again, stronger than before and resulting in cargo shifting from the trailers. A list of 45 deg to port was experienced and the master decided to bring the vessel head to wind. He applied full starboard wheel and the vessel turned rapidly, thus increasing the angle of heel. As the vessel became broadside to the wind this also added to the total heeling effect and a maximum list/heel of 60 deg was reported.
The vessel turned from a heading of 090 to 170 in 70 seconds. She then lost one of her two engines due to lube oil low pressure trip and would not come any closer to the wind. At this time the master contacted the Coast Guard.
Attempts to restart the engine were made and to transfer ballast to bring her upright. During this time Riverdance drifted towards the Shell Flat sands off the coast near Blackpool. Around 2300 hrs UTC she grounded on Shell Flat on a falling tide.
Initially 14 persons were evacuated by helicopter leaving 9 onboard attempting to stabilise the situation. Whilst aground the list decresed to about 25 deg. Ballast was transfered ready for coming off on the next rising tide in the morning. 
Once the vessel was starting to refloat the engines were put astern in an attempt to bring her into deeper water, the wind and seas were still storm force from the West and the engines had no effect. After about two hours, attempts to re float the vessel were stopped, Riverdance then came broadside to the weather and sufferred a sudden severe heeling over to starboard. The remaining crew were taken off the vessel and Riverdance was left aground with a heel of about 40 deg.
Subsequent attempts to refloat and salvage the vessel failed.  ","RORO CARGO","Total loss of the ship","6041","DNV AS (DNV)","3046","Trailers","19","4","","0","0","0","0","0","0","2009-09-04",""

The skipper had served on board for about 1 year, but for many of the 15 crew this was their first trip in the vessel.  
At about 20.00 hours on 18 January the long-line was shot away.  The crew then rested in their cabins until they were called at 01.00 hours LT to recover it.  At about 06.30 hours LT on 19 January 2008 , thick black smoke was seen coming from one of the crew’s cabins, but the smoke detection system alarm had not sounded.  Some of the crew attempted to fight the fire but they were quickly beaten back as the thick, acrid smoke quickly spread through the accommodation area.  Although a number of watertight doors were left open near to the fire, containment was established.     Four of the crew suffered smoke inhalation.
The skipper asked a nearby Spanish fishing vessel to stand by in case they had to abandon the vessel. 
The main fire pump could not be started because the electrical control circuits had been destroyed.  The emergency manual fire pump was defective, so there was no pressurised water supply with which to fight the fire.  As the paint on the main deck started to blister, the skipper attempted to starve the fire of oxygen, but he was hampered by faulty ventilation isolating valves, and had to stuff rags around the ventilation terminals.  The rags were later removed, and the fire re-ignited. At 12.31 hours LT the skipper finally alerted the Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centre (MRCC) at Madrid, 6 hours after the fire had started.  Emergency service support was quickly provided.  The Irish Naval vessel, LE Eithne, arrived on the scene and transferred a fire party, who extinguished the fires.  SHARK was then escorted into Killibegs for inspection.
The fire caused extensive damage throughout the accommodation area.  The investigation found numerous examples of private electrical equipment connected to the cabin supplies, and electrical cables were found to be chafed where they passed over the rough edges of the cabin bulkheads.  The fire was probably of electrical origin, caused by a faulty supply cable.  The fire detection system had been intentionally disabled, and much of the emergency equipment was in poor condition.  SHARK was also out of date for her Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) Intermediate Survey.  None of the crew had the required mandatory safety course certificates, the skipper did not hold the required Certificate of Equivalent Competency and no emergency training drills had been carried out.

The OOW and the duty crewmember on the dredger were engaged with regulating the depth of the the suction pipe, which had gone too deeply into the sea bed. Thus they had not observed the approaching cargo ship RUBYN.

The collision resulted in severe hull damage to the dredger. However the crew succeeded in trimming the ship to port and thus the leakages partly came over the water level.

As the vessel was moving backwards with the assistance of the tug Achilleas, strong winds caused her to drift, and her starboard side touched the small tug boat Pillon that was moored at the side of the dock. 
The damage caused to the tug Pillon was only a small dent on her starboard side shell above the water line, and no injuries were caused to the crew of the tug or our vessel's crew. 
Our vessel then anchored to the outer anchorage of Volos port and the Master was taken ashore to the port authorities to testify about this incident. 
The port authorities came onboard and inspected our vessel in order to see if any damage had been caused by the minor collision, and after concluding that there was none, allowed the vessel to sail to her destination of Yuzny/Ukraine.

During the berthing operation, while the stern was being manoeuvred away from a dolphin, which was on the starboard quarter, and the tug pulling on the bow, the port quarter fell down faster than desired and the belting made contact with the forward edge of a fender.  A stiffening bracket inside the belting punctured the hull in the way of the port steering gear compartment, causing a tear of 300mm x 60mm. The vessel was taken out of class while repairs were affected. After approval of the repairs by Lloyds and MCA, the vessel sailed 8 hours after the accident.

The master recommended that the vessel should be stopped short of the dolphin in adverse weather to achieve a more controlled landing alongside.

On 24th November at 11.12 hours LT,  pilot boarded the vessel and commenced with heaving of starboard anchor, but stopped immediately as its cable was leading astern. There was a strong onshore wind blowing, and the vessel weighed the port anchor, but even then the starboard cable was still leading astern. At this juncture the pilot thought that the vessel probably might have smelt the ground, and with the cable leading aft it would lead it closer to the bank.
Under the circumstances, the pilot advised getting assistance from a tug in order to avoid any grounding or nearing the bank while heaving up the anchors, and to then proceed to the berth.
The pilot informed the coast guard,who thought that in normal conditions no vessel uses a tug to heave anchor and there might have been a probable grounding or smelling of the bank by the vessel. 
The captain of the port(USCG) issued a notice that the vessel had to be checked by the classification society.
At 12.00 hours LT the  tug was made fast and the vessel commenced weighing the starboard anchor. The tug was eventually cast off in six minutes and the vessel was underway at 12.18 hours LT.  crew As per company procedures, ship's crew made an immediate check of all tanks and a visual check of hull inside engine room, and found all in order.

Once back on board the chief officer decided to go to the mess room to make a cup of tea.  The crew in the reception area then heard a call and found the chief officer at the bottom of the stairs.  He had badly cut his head and was not breathing.  Mouth to mouth and CPR were immediately carried out.  The master apparently stumbled on hydraulic pipework on the bridge as he tried to make a call to the emergency services.  There is a very strong suspicion that the master was drunk and had stumbled.

Once the emergency services were on scene it was clear that the chief officer was dead.  Unfortunately no breath tests were taken.  The police declared the ship to be a crime scene but it became soon apparent that this was a sad alcohol related accident.

El B/T Liberiano “High Endeavour”, es una nave tanquera de doble casco,  construida el año 2004, la cual ya  había prestado servicios de  transporte de hidrocarburos, recalando a los Puertos de Iquique, Antofagasta y Quintero, en los años 2005 y 2007.
Su Armador corresponde a una compañía que opera un número importante de naves, la cuál en este viaje debió por asuntos comerciales, cambiar el puerto de desembarque de la carga, desde Quintero a San Vicente, distantes aproximadamente a un día de navegación.

La travesía a este nuevo puerto, al igual que la maniobra de ingreso, al atraque al terminal “C” de Enap Refinerías Bío Bío, se realizó sin novedad, a pesar de que como se constataría mas tarde, la nave no contaba con una  carta náutica de  escala apropiada para graficar las situaciones y llevar un control adecuado de la derrota de entrada y salida al puerto,

El 10 de Noviembre de 2007, habiendo terminado la descarga y  faenas de desamarrado  del terminal, inició la navegación en demanda del canalizo de salida del dispositivo de separación de tráfico para salir de la bahía. Posterior a la largada de remolcadores y producido ya el desembarco del Práctico del Puerto, tocó fondo en el Bajo “Roca Villa de Burdeos”, el cual está a estribor del canalizo de salida y demarcado con una baliza luminosa lateral, según los estándares internacionales de balizamiento. 

El equipo de puente, no siguió las recomendaciones del derrotero, ni las indicadas en  otras publicaciones náuticas, como tampoco las que habría dado el  Práctico, respecto a la navegación para alcanzar el Esquema  de Separación de Tráfico, ya que después que éste desembarcó la nave se dispusieron cambios de rumbo sucesivos que sumados a las condiciones de viento reinantes, la llevaron a estribor, hasta tocar fondo fuera del mencionado esquema.

Producto del accidente, no se registraron lesiones a personas, ni contaminación al medio ambiente marino y los daños se circunscribieron a  la obra viva, con abolladuras y fracturas de casco, comprometiendo la integridad de 3 estanques de lastre, al quedar comunicados con el mar. 

La estabilidad de la nave no fué afectada gravemente, pero en consideración a la magnitud de los daños, debió ser sometida a reparaciones en dique, previo a reiniciar actividades comerciales.

Investigations revealed that the direct cause of the accident was due to the accidental opening of the inlet valve by his colleague. The shore technicians were working on the same main engine liner. 

Cause of the Incident	  
The root cause of the incident was failure to comply with the shipboard safety management practices while personnel were working inside the liner.

On 23rd October 2007  the Ålandsfärjan was en route from Kapellskär, Sweden to Mariehamn, Åland. When the vessel entered the Mariehamn archipelago the OOW reported the vessel's arrival to the VTS area. After doing this he turned his attention to a computer that was placed on the  table at the bridge. His intention was to take a quick look at the working schedule, but he became engrossed in the information he found and lost track of time. 
When the master arrived to the bridge he could see that the vessel was about to run aground and it was too late to doing anything about it.  He immediately put the engines on full astern and managed to reduce the speed a few knots before the vessel grounded at 14.04 hours LT. The vessel was later able to proceed to Mariehamn by its own power.

The engineer, who was located on the bridge immediately viewed the enclosure and confirmed that there was a small but discernible flash indicating a fire.  The enclosure UV sensors picked up the fire and the automatic shut down and fire extinguishing process activated.  The engine was shut down, and the fuel, ventilation, air intake and exhaust systems were isolated.  The CO2 system was discharged into the enclosure and the fire was seen to die down and be extinguished.  In the meantime the captain alerted the passengers, and as a precaution they were issued with lifejackets.  The fire team confirmed that the fire was out - the whole fire incident lasted about 2 minutes.  It was decided to return to the departure port on the starboard hull engines.  The passengers were stood down from emergency stations a short time later.

The affected engine had its power turbine replaced as part of the lifed programme of components the previous day. However the General Electric contractors were used to dealing with aero engines which do not have a powere turbine fitted as this one does.   This trip was the first since the change.  On investigation it was found that the module, power turbine channel plate recess had some oil residue in it that was soaked up by the power turbine to exhaust lagging.  It was also found that there was a hot gas leak from the power turbine to piston seal, exhaust joint that heated up the lagging and ignited the oil that was soaked in it.  There was no damage except for a small scorch mark identifying the source of the gas leak.  The contractors attended the vessel and rectified the leak and the lagging has been replaced.  All auto drains have been cleaned and checked to ensure oil that oil leakage is directed to the drain tank as designed.

At approximately 06:15, Blithe Spirit left Falmouth and headed south towards the Manacles at a speed of between 18 and 26 knots. Shortly after leaving the harbour, the skipper of Blithe Spirit, who was operating single handed, altered course to port to avoid a cluster of unidentified lights ahead of him. Once steady on his new course, with the way ahead apparently clear, he sat down to rest.
 At approximately 06:22 hrs, Blithe Spirit and Lady Hamilton of Helford collided. The crew of Lady Hamilton of Helford were thrown to the deck and covered in debris. Lady Hamilton of Helford was holed above and below the waterline and started to rapidly take on water. Her skipper used a mobile phone to inform the coastguard while his crew launched a liferaft. The liferaft did not fully inflate and was unusable. Fortunately, a local pilot boat quickly arrived on the scene and recovered the skipper and his crew. The damaged ship was taken in tow but sank at 06:46 hrs. When the two ships collided, the skipper of Blithe Spirit hit his head on a

A short time after leaving port, at 07.40 hours LT, the bridge fire alarm panel sounded indicating that the port main engine oil mist detector had activated.  The chief engineer was able to confirm with the master, who was on the bridge, that there was no fire.  The master informed the passengers of the mechanical situation.  In the meantime the chief engineer confirmed that the port main engine crankcase explosion doors had lifted which had caused the oil mist detector to activate. The port engine was immediately shut down by the chief engineer from the engine control room. The engine was subsequently declutched from the gearbox.

Investigations later identified that No 6 cylinder liner and piston were badly scuffed.  This allowed the cylinder compression gases to pass into the crankcase causing the overpressure which lifted the crankcase explosion doors.  The engine manufacturers found that the oil cooling to the underside of the piston was interrupted by the oil nozzle deflector plate being disturbed.  This caused the oil to flow down the con rod instead of to the underside of the piston.  The piston expanded causing partial seizure.  This resulted in piston and liner scoring, which allowed the compression gases to pass by the piston, pressurising the crankcase.  

The other piston cooling arrangements were checked and were found to be satisfactory.

Freeboard of Katrine Krog was approximately 3 m and the pilot ladder had been deployed to approximately 1 m above waterline.

The German pilot pointed out the loose step to the crew of Katrine Krog. When there was no response, he decided to leave out the damaged step by directly stepping onto spreader above. As soon as he stood there with both feet, the rope of the pilot ladder tore off on both sides above the top step. Thereupon the pilot fell down with the torn odd pilot ladder onto the pilot launch, suffering injuries. He managed to embark without  a pilot ladder and to pilot the ship to “Alte Schleuse” locks in Kiel-Holtenau. Katrine Krog continued her voyage after a stopover at the locks.

As a result of his injured, the pilot was unable to work for three days. Nobody else was injured. No damage to property occurred and no environmentally harmful substances were released.

Amongst other things, the wave of pressure forced open the doors (A60) that lead in and out of the room. One of the doors came into contact with a diesel pipeline resulting in diesel leakage. A manual warning system was activated when the doors were opened by the pressure wave. There was no indication that a fire had occurred in the room.

A crewmember entered the room immediately after the explosion. He was equipped with a flashlight and estimated visibility to be approximately 2 metres. The smoke in the room was perceived to be grey. The crewmembers did not register if the smoke had a particular smell as the diesel leakage emitted a strong diesel odour. The crewmember that entered the room did not proceed very far into the room before returning out again. It was decided to attend to sealing the diesel leakage.

The causal factor of the explosion was identified to be the overheating and subsequent meltdown of an electrical capacitor. This meltdown generated a flammable gas developed from the insulation material in the capacitor. The gas was probably ignited either by the heat from the capacitor or from an electrical spark from one of the electrical breakers.

The vessel was laden with 28 units of LONG TRUCKS/TRAILERS (total weight est.1120 MT: out of which there were 27 empty trailers+1 loaded). The Pilot-Capt Mehmet Kulak guided the vessel out of the port and disembarked at approximately 06:40 hours LT. The weather conditions, as per Turkish Gov.METEO report for Sept 14 2007 @ 06:30 LT, stated that: winds W-NW 4-6 ,SEA 1.5 to 2.5 M , Visibility-GOOD. There were no restrictions imposed due to the weather conditions or any other conditions.
During the first six (6) hours the vessel's speed was calculated to be approx. 6.6 KTS. The course was plotted as 359 degrees, but was adjusted due to pitching/pounding to a more favorable course, but by that time the weather conditions had worsened.
At about 12:10 LT the vessel suddenly listed 5-6 degrees to Starboard and then shortly after that listed 2 degree to Port side, and remained listed like that. At approx. 12:25 LT Chief Officer Mr. Husnu Erhan(Turkish National), reported from the main garage deck that sea water was flooding into the garage area. Water was entering through the stern ramp on the Port side and there was already approximately 30-35 cm of water inside the main garage deck. Pump out orders were given but more water was coming in. By this time the vessel list had increased to 5-6 degrees to Port side and was getting worse.
At approx. 12:40 LT the Chief Officer reported the situation to the Turkish Marine Radio Station-TURK RADIO . He also spoke with company DPA Mr.Serdar Erden at the Operator's office. (Transcript of the radio call is available from TURK RADIO ). A MAY-DAY distress call was placed, but by then the vessel had listed further to about 20 degrees. Some of the trucks/trailers on the upper open deck went over the side( 3 units went over the port side ).
At about 12:42 LT the Master called the engine room and ordered all crew to abandon their positions from the machinery spaces. Shortly afterwards the remaining crew and 11 truck drivers were ordered to muster station on the boat deck. Attempts to deploy the two life boats both failed. The
Starboard side life raft was then deployed . The Port side life raft was also deployed but remained connected to the vessel and eventually sank with the vessel. At about 13:10 LT the vessel list increased to aprox. 35 degree and at that time the Master gave verbal orders to abandon the vessel. At 13:20 LT all the crew had abandoned vessel by jumping into the water.
At about 14:00 LT the vessel sank, with the stern going down first .
Rescue efforts were launched and the tanker BATOVA and Turkish tanker TUGCE-T arrived on the scene and rescued most of the crew members and truck drivers. The remainder o the crew was rescued by Turkish Coast Guard chopper. All the crew and truck drivers were safely rescued.
Up until the time of this report, there have been no reports of pollution in the area where the vessel sank.

At that point the situation had become dangerous to the crew members, and at 14.25 hours the Master grounded the vessel near the beach area of the port to avoid capsizing. With the assistance of salvors and lightening of cargo the vessel was re-floated on 13th September 2007. the vessel was then anchored at the old new Manglore port. There were no casualties and no environmental damage. ","GENERAL CARGO","Ship remains fit to proceed","11175","","17240","16,100 M.T. Ironore Fines","","","","","","","","","","",""

The procedure involved adding crushed fruit nut shells to a funnel on the turbo charger inlet.  When the funnel was at the required level, compressed air at between 6-8 bars was opened onto the funnel, which then discharged the shells into the turbo charger through a valve arrangement.  The abrasion effect of the shells cleans the turbo charger.  This operation is undertaken every 24- 48 hours.

On this occasion, when the compressed air was admitted to the system the sealing olive on the copper discharge pipe to the turbo charger failed and the shells were ejected under pressure onto the arms and back of the third engineer.  This caused extensive and severe abrasion to his forearms which required him to be hospitalised.

Investigations found that the copper discharge pipe was largely unsupported throughout its length and this caused the connection sealing olive to fail through fatigue.  It was further found that the third engineer had his coverall sleeves rolled up and was therefore unprotected.  Where his back was protected by his coveralls he suffered minimal damage.

The pipe work has since been correctly supported and clipped and the requirement for coverall sleeves to be fully rolled down re-iterated by the ship¿s and management company¿s safety committees.

One of the tasks the crew was to complete while the ship was at anchor was the removal of steel brackets that had been welded to the hatch covers.

In the process of removing the brackets with oxy-acetylene cutting equipment, a hole was inadvertently cut in the aft cargo hold hatch cover. As a result, sparks and molten metal fell into the cargo hold and onto the pallets of cargo stowed below.  

At about 13.40 hours LT, smoke was noticed coming from the aft cargo hold. The general alarm was sounded and the master decided to use the ship’s fixed fire extinguishing system to flood the cargo hold with carbon dioxide.

The harbour master was notified and he arranged for the ship to be brought alongside the wharf.

By 13.12 hours on 16 August, BBC Islander was all fast alongside the wharf and the local fire- fighting authorities took control of the response. Initially, they tried flooding the cargo hold with more carbon dioxide. They then attempted to remove the cargo in order to reach the seat of the fire and extinguish it with the use of fire hoses. Eventually, the hold was filled with high expansion foam. However, none of these actions extinguished the fire.

On 18th August, the fire was finally extinguished when an offshore supply vessel’s fire monitor was used to flood BBC Islander’s aft cargo hold with about 700 tonnes of seawater.

As a precaution the engine was being prepared to be stopped when the motorman saw what he believed to be smoke in the vicinity of the engine.  The engine emergency stop was operated, the hi-fog system was released and propeller pitch limited to 70%.  The smoke detection system of the fire alarm panel sounded and the engineers alarm was activated.  The vessel speed was reduced to slow ahead.
At 01.20 hours LT, the captain and command team arrived on the bridge and the crew went to alert stations. At 01.25 hours LT the situation was reported as being under control and the engine room was ventilated to remove the apparent smoke.  All areas were confirmed normal at 01.40 hours LT.

Subsequent investigations found that No 8 cylinder of the affected engine had suffered liner scoring which resulted in the compressed fuel/air mixture passing into the engine sump.  The sump became pressurised which then cased the crankcase explosion doors to open, discharging oil vapour into the engine room.  There was no fire.

1.2.	At the time of the accident the CONDOR EXPRESS was completing loading at the East berth of Elizabeth Harbour.
1.3.	Originally it had been planned for HD1 to berth on the East berth. The East berth is also the preferred operating berth for other HSC operating into the port as the Link span is self supporting and permits simultaneous load/discharge or 2 door load on the 74 & 86m Incat vessels. A delay in the loading operation and departure of CONDOR EXPRESS necessitated the change of berthing plan and alternative arrangements.
1.4.	The decision to enter port and berth on the less suitable West berth was made by the master in conjunction with the port control. The choice was made in preference to waiting outside the harbour, in reaction to worsening weather conditions. The HD1 had a Jersey Pilot on board.
1.5.	Both vessels were registered in the Bahamas.
1.6.	There were no reported injuries to passengers or crew of either vessel.  
1.7.	HD1 suffered penetration of the hull on the port side, affecting three longitudinal compartments with distortion of shell plating and structure in a further two compartments.  The damage was found to be about 0.7m above the waterline at the time. Apart from insignificant splash accumulations in the holed compartments of HD1 there was no influx of water to the damaged hull.
1.8.	CONDOR EXPRESS sustained superficial damage to the starboard bow that, after inspection was deemed not to affect the seaworthiness of the vessel and there was no influx of water.

When the ship was loaded and had departed from the berth, a rescue vessel was standby to help to turn the ship around. The passenger ship went astern the stern facing the wind. After a short distance, the ship stopped and swung around to port. At this point, the wind was on port side, approximately 15 m/s. The wind was strong on port side and the ship drifted to starboard. The ship was getting closer and closer to the end of the pier, which the ship subsequently hit. 

While this was happening, attempts were made to navigate the ship further starboard. After the collision with the pier, the ship was navigated to the outer habour where the rescue vessel examined the damage. It was established that there were indentures and a hole.

The ship had been scheduled to have a slurry of about 116 000 dry tonnes of iron sand mixed with water pumped aboard. Earlier during the loading process the ship's duct keel had flooded with water from the slurry-loading process, disabling the ship's ballast and cargo de-watering systems. The water had gravitated from the cargo overflow recesses into the duct keel through welding access holes left unsealed after steel renewal in dry dock prior to the loading voyage. When the Taharoa Express departed Port Taharoa it had an estimated 17 800 cubic metres (m3)of water on top of the iron sand that had settled in 5 of its cargo holds, as well as number 6 water ballast hold and several ballast tanks being partially full.
The ship initially had a 1.5 degree (°) starboard list when it sailed.
During the voyage to Tasman Bay, the starboard list progressively increased, unnoticed by key personnel on board until about 01:50 hours on 22 June when the ship took a larger roll that woke key personnel, who found that the ship had a 17° starboard list. The Taharoa Express was manoeuvred for the remainder of the trip to Tasman Bay to minimise the motion of the ship in the heavy seas, but the list reached 22° before the ship reached the shelter of Tasman Bay.

The cause of the list was the progressive shift of iron sand in all loaded holds owing to wash action caused by sloshing free water, and possibly contributed to by an en masse shift of iron sand in one or more cargo holds.

Weather conditions were good, including visibility. WIND/SEAS N-NE'ly 10 KTS/2.
Traffic in ship channel was light.
At approx. 21.15 hours LT a push boat and barge were noticed over the ship's port bow about 1,3 miles away, navigating in opposite course to the MSC PEGGY. Pilot estabilished contact via VHF with skipper of push boat and requested passing ""PORT TO PORT"". Moments later master and pilot noticed the push boat and barge turning to their port and then stopping, thus blocking the navigational channel. The Pilot confirmed with push boat skipper that push boat lost steering at this time, as MSC PEGGY was making 10 KTS trough the water. At 21.20 hours LT the Master ordered the course be changed to port, with the intention of steering away from imminent collission with push BOAT/BARGE. Engine was given ""ASTERN"".
At 21.22 hours LT the vessel ran aground to the east side of the navigational channel, although
no grounding impact was felt. Soon afterwards, by using ship's engine and bow truster, the
vessel was able to re-float free and continue her passage. Pilot advised United States Coast Guard, who in turn instructed vessel to proceed to FW Anchorage. Divers' survey revealed no damage to the under water parts of the vessel, nor its attachments. USCG rescinded restriction and allowed vessel to proceed on her intended voyage.

At midday on 7 June, Pasha Bulker’s master veered more anchor cable after a gale warning was issued. The weather deteriorated and shortly after midnight, the wind had reached gale force.

The master decided to put to sea and at 07.48 hours LT the anchor was aweigh. The ship was then 1.2 miles from the shore and, with, the southeast wind fine on the starboard bow, it made good a north-easterly course. At 09.06 hours LT , the master altered the ship’s course to starboard to put the wind on the port bow in an attempt to make good a southerly course on a south-southeasterly heading. However, its heading became south-westerly and, with the wind on the port beam, the ship started to rapidly approach the coast.

The voyage from Papenburg to Istanbul had been interrupted at Emden as a result of technical defects.
During a Port State Control the representative of the See-BG had, amongst other deficiencies, ascertained deficiencies in the performance of the lifeboat drill and had issued a detention order.
The FOREST-1's single lifeboat was a combined life and rescue boat.
The crew carried out drills to improve their skills.  On 16 May 2007, after an initial drill, the ship's command ordered a second drill to be carried out.  All stations were manned by the same persons as in the first attempt.  While lowering the boat there was an incident that produced an increased load on the releasing hooks.  Thereupon the aft releasing hook opened.  The boat swung downwards, still held by the forward releasing hook.  As a result of the excessive load, the forward releasing hook thereupon tore out of the hull of the lifeboat which fell into the water from a height of 7m.  Ingress of water caused a quick sinking of the stern.  
Three of the six seamen in the boat were able to exit it.  Two men died, one was seriously injured.  The casualties were recovered by rescue personnel.","GENERAL CARGO","Loss of life,Serious injuries,Ship remains fit to proceed","2608","St. Kitts and Nevis International Ship Registry (SKNISR)","3114","","","","","2","","","1","","","2008-08-19","2009-04-28"

At about 0512, the ship rounded the Hovell Pile beacon and entered the South Channel in Port Phillip. At about 0521, Ormiston entered ‘The Cut’, the narrowest part of the channel, from the east making good about 15 knots.
At about 0230, the second mate on board the roll-on/roll-off general cargo ship Searoad Mersey contacted Point Lonsdale vessel traffic service (VTS) to provide an estimated time of arrival at the entrance to Port Phillip and was advised of the traffic movements within the port. At about 0420, Searoad Mersey’s master, who also held a pilotage exemption for Port Phillip and had conducted over 1300 transits of the port, contacted VTS and received updated traffic information, including Ormiston’s estimated movements.
At about 0435, Searoad Mersey passed Point Lonsdale lighthouse and entered Port Phillip. At about 0521, when the ship entered ‘The Cut’ from the west making good about 15 knots, the master had forgotten that Ormiston was approaching and did not see the approaching ship until immediately before the two ships passed. At about 0523, Searoad Mersey and Ormiston passed within 20 metres of each other in ‘The Cut’ at a combined speed of about 30 knots.
The ATSB investigation found that Searoad Mersey’s bridge team members had not effectively implemented bridge resource management principles, were not keeping an adequate lookout and had lost situational awareness. The investigation also found that the ships did not communicate with each other until after the incident and that the Point Lonsdale VTS was not aware of the incident until after it had occurred.
The ATSB has issued four recommendations and one safety advisory notice to address the safety issues identified in the report.","Bulk Carrier","Ship remains fit to proceed","13909","","16602","","","","","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","2008-07-25","2010-08-11"

Before starting on the planned passage thought the Kiel Canal, the Emuna tied up for a stopover at the South Quay in Brunsbuttel.

On the North western Roadstead (NW-Reede) before Brunsbuttel the German canal pilot came on board via the pilot’s transfer platform. Once at the South Quay in Brunsbuttel, a pilot ladder was deployed for the pilot to disembark. This pilot ladder had been damaged the previous day during an incident in Great Britain, when a pilot boat briefly got entangled with the ladder.
The bottom steps, which had been partially detached in the incident, had been removed on board the Emuna, whereupon the ladder was considered fit for further use.

When on the day of the accident the pilot, who had not been informed of the damage, stepped onto the pilot ladder, the ropes tore on both sides. The pilot fell a distance of several meters and landed on a wooden fender fitted in front of the quay wall. In doing so he suffered not insignificant injuries, as a result of which he was unable to work for three weeks.

Nobody else was injured. No environmental harmful substances were released.

After the collision, Peter Crombie’s skipper tried to contact the ship using his vessel’s very high frequency radio. However, SILKY CROMBIE’s bridge watchkeeper did not acknowledge the call and made no attempt to communicate with the fishing vessel. 

While SILKY OCEAN sustained no damage as a result of the collision, Peter Crombie’s hull had been severely damaged and the vessel was taking on water. Fortunately, the fishing vessel’s bilge pumps were able to keep up with the ingress of water.

The vessel was built in Spain for Russian flag in 1990 and was purchased from Vanuatu by a Faroese company in February 2007 and registered in the Faroese Register of Shipping together with her sister ship POSEIDON. 

The vessels were fishing with pelagic trawls after horse mackerel in the South Pacific Ocean. The catch was frozen without being processed and stowed into the freezing hold.

There were 116 crew members, technicians and ship’s officers on board, spread over 6 nationalities.

On Friday 20 April, the chief engineer of POSEIDON discovered that two newly in-stalled fixtures for fluorescent tubes had become overheated and begun melting the plastic sockets for the tubes and subsequently the plastic covers of the fixtures. The same type of fixtures had also been installed in HERCULES.
 
The chief engineer switched off the electric power supply for these fixtures and warned his colleague in HERCULES by an E-mail the warning.

On the same evening, a fire broke out on board HERCULES in the hold on 1st deck, where great amounts of plastic and corrugated cardboard packing were stored.

Very dense smoke spread extremely fast all over the vessel and also to the bridge, because a large number of doors and hatches were open, and because a cable shaft was leading not divided into sections from the cargo hold on 2nd deck up to a low space below the bridge.

The fire alarm systems functioned for a very short while and had only a poor effect.

A distress signal was transmitted via VHF to other fishing vessels in the vicinity. Four vessels arrived to give assistance within approximately one hour.

The crew gathered on the forecastle while smoke divers were searching in the accom-modation to get all crew members out.

Due to lack of air supply in their air breathing apparatuses it was necessary to dismiss the smoke divers quickly.

No fire fighting was carried out inside the vessel due to lack of air supply in the air breathing apparatuses.

11 crew members perished due to smoke inhalation.

105 persons were evacuated from the ship to other fishing vessels by the use of the vessel’s life rafts.

The vessel was on fire for approximately three weeks. All processing compartments, cargo spaces, accommodation and other machinery spaces burned out. The engine room remained almost undamaged by the fire. Approximately one month after the fire broke out, the vessel was towed to a Chilean port. It was eventually declared a ‘Total Constructive Loss’.

The vessel had prior to the capsizing experienced severe difficulties maintaining the intended course. It had deviated in an E direction towards deployed anchor chain no 3, and was at the time of capsizing about 900 m E of intended track/position. Immediately prior to capsizing inner starboard tow pin was lowered and the chain applied its force towards the outer port tow pin. Subsequently the vessel experienced a list of about 20-40° to port for about 15 s before righting itself. Then the vessel listed to port again and capsized. The winch emergency release was active during the final list/capsize.

The wind was at near gale and the surface current has been estimated in excess of 2.5 m/s in E direction. The rig and BD had about 1800 m of anchor chain between them. 

Offshore Tug/Supply Ship Highland Valour (IMO no 9249506) had about 1 hr prior to the capsizing grappled the anchor chain behind BD in an attempt to assist the BD back on intended track. This attempt was, however, unsuccessful and culminated 40 min prior to the capsizing in a near collision between Highland Valour (HV) and BD. During evasive manouvering HV lost its grip on the chain and did not attempt to grapple again.  There is currently no indication that this incident contributed to the capsize of BD some 40 minutes later.

The BD had 14 crewmembers and one passenger (14 y.o.). 7 of the crewmembers and the 14 year old boy were lost. 

BD remained afloat after the capsize. During the rescue operations attempt was made by divers from the UK Coast Guard to enter the hull to search for possible survivors. This was aborted due to safety concerns for the divers. The vessel was examined by Rescue Operator Vehicle (ROV).

At 2116 on 15. of April the vessel sank at about 1100 m depth. The anchor chain had been cut in preparation of the salvage operation and to remove the vessel away from the rig.","TUG/SUPPLY SHIP (O.R.S.V.)","Total loss of the ship,Loss of life","2985","DNV AS (DNV)","2500","N/A","14","1","0","7","1","","","","","2008-07-17","2009-04-28"

When anchored, the crew set the barge’s anchor lights to operate automatically using a timer.
At about 06.10 hours LT on 18 March, in near total darkness, the recreational vessel, Norma Jean, with four persons on board, left the Carnarvon boat harbour. At about 06.25 Norma Jean collided with Seatow 61 and sank almost immediately. All four occupants of the boat died as a result of the collision.
The ATSB investigation found that Norma Jean’s skipper may not have seen the barge until seconds before the impact and may have mistaken the barge’s anchor lights for the lights of two separate vessels. Norma Jean’s speed was inappropriate for the dark conditions and the use of the boat’s interior lights probably reduced the skipper’s night vision. 
The investigation also found that the Carnarvon harbour master, who is based in Perth, about 900 km south of Carnarvon, was not fully aware of recreational vessel activities in Carnarvon when providing advice on where to anchor the barge.

The master and chief engineer were informed and regular 30 minutes monitoring rounds were established as had become normal practice.  At 1650 the room temperature was recorded at 62 deg C.  At 1711 the ship experienced a blackout and at the same time the ship lost its 6.6.kV main propulsion power supply and at 1714 the smoke detector in the transformer room lobby activated.  The fire party assembled, HV supplies were isolated and the HV transformer room door opened to allow the fire team to attack the fire.  The fire was confirmed extinguished at 1732.  The integrated Platform Management System was re-instated .  As a result of the fire and water damage to the port pre-magnatizing transformer the port propulsion system could not be used.

The vessel made its way under its own power to port.

1.- El día 27 de Febrero del 2007,  fondea en el Puerto de  San Antonio, el Bulk Carrier “Port Victoria”, de bandera Islas Marshall número IMO 9262637, procedente del puerto de San Lorenzo Argentina, con sus cinco bodegas, conteniendo graneles para descargar en el terminal Puerto Panul.

2.- Previo al inicio de la descarga, se hace necesaria la acreditación ante la Autoridad Marítima de la condición de “Gas Free”, debido a que el fumigante empleado (Fosfina), inflamable y perjudicial para el hombre dependiendo de su concentración y tiempo de exposición,  podria causar incluso la muerte. Por lo anterior, se procura la ausencia  de gases de fumigantes en las bodegas de manera que exista un ambiente en condición segura para su ingreso. Esta condición se logra mediante una ventilación natural y forzada, transcurrido 5 días de su embarque, durante la navegación al puerto de descarga.

El proceso de fumigación mencionado se inicia insertando en la parte superior de la carga, a través de lancetas a una profundidad promedio de 50 cm,  tabletas de fosfuro de aluminio, las cuales al cabo de una o dos horas, comienzan a descomponerse liberando el gas llamado fosfina, el que por ser más pesado que el aire, va descendiendo por los intersticios entre los granos, demandando aproximadamente cuatro a cinco días en llegar al fondo de  bodega. 

El compuesto remanente, una vez generado el gas, es un hidróxido de aluminio el cual contiene hasta un 2% de fosfina, lo que es  inocuo para el ser humano, animales y aves. La principal característica adversa de este residuo (hidróxido de aluminio) es el hecho que el fosfuro remanente reacciona exotérmicamente al entrar en contacto con el agua.

3.- El producto pellet de girasol, es un granel de origen vegetal, no tiene condiciones explosivas, pero ante un aumento de humedad produce  una acidificación de las grasas y quema de proteínas, generando una fuente de calor que condensa humedad y aumenta la temperatura llegando a un punto que puede generar un proceso de autocombustión y la creación de un ciclo continuo que se auto-alimenta.

4.-  La nave recala a puerto con un foco de incendio controlado en la bodega N°5.

The incident occurred while the vessel was in the  Arabian Sea, en-route from Singapore to Port Suez. While working with the other crew in renewing the port lifeboat falls, the victim suffered severe head and arm injuries when he was hit by the handle of the lifeboat winch drum. The victim was then taken to the ship’s hospital for the crew to administer first aid and medical treatment. In the meantime, the vessel was diverted and radio medical advice was sought but he showed no vital signs of life around 22.00 hours LT. The body of the victim was landed ashore on 22 February 2007 in Cochin (India) for post mortem, and later returned to the Philippines.

Investigations revealed that the direct cause of the accident was due to the simultaneous starting of the winch motor while manual cranking by handle was in progress. The brief rotation of the motor caused the handle to rotate at high speed and strike the victim on the back of the skull resulting in the fatal injury.

Cause of the Incident	  
The root cause of the incident was failure to comply with the shipboard safety management practices while conducting the renewal of port lifeboat falls. The vessel decided to circumvent the electrical safety system of the lifeboat winch motor and failed to implement the “Lockout / Tagout” system. The Electrical Officer was trying to start the lifeboat winch motor from the switchboard and was not aware that the crew was using manual cranking at the same time.

El día 10 de febrero de 2007, en el Terminal Marítimo, ubicado en la bahía de Mejillones, Región de Antofagasta, Chile.  La Grúa Nº 1 descargaba carbón mineral con una cuchara bivalva  de 20 m3 de levante SWL, marca BLUG, desde la bodega Nº 6 de la M/N MIDEN MAX de bandera Isle of Man, atracada al terminal desde el día 07 de febrero. Aproximadamente a las 19:01 horas, la Grúa Nº 1 colapsa, quebrándose la pluma principal al doblarse sobre sí misma, a corta distancia sobre el punto de aplicación del husillo (mecanismo de cambio del alcance de la grúa), cayendo parcialmente los restos de ésta sobre la tapa de la bodega N° 7 de la Nave, sin que se registraran personas lesionadas.

La quebradura de la pluma, se produjo en el momento en que la cuchara de carga, empezaba a levantar una carga de carbón, sin que se constatara ningún tipo de acción indebida por parte del operador; por atrapamiento de la cuchara o se activara algún tipo de alarma, en el sistema de operación.
El Operador de la grúa se encontraba trabajando, desde las tres primeras horas de su turno. Tenía ocho años de experiencia, tanto en la operación de la grúa, como de trabajo efectuado en el terminal. 

El colapso de la grúa, consistió en el rompimiento de la pluma principal, al doblarse sobre sí misma en un punto ubicado a corta distancia, sobre la zona de aplicación del husillo del mecanismo que regula la extensión de la pluma y el alcance de la grúa. Determinándose como causas principales, el exceso de carga de cuchara bivalva y la parada brusca y repetitiva, después de recorrer una distancia vertical de mas de dos metros con exceso de carga, hasta accionarse el sistema sensor de carga regulado a las 20 toneladas SWL; descartándose de esta forma operación indebida o alguna circunstancia climática en la zona.

Se detectó diferencias estructurales en las grúas del terminal, coincidente con los años de construcción de cada una de ellas. La Grúa Nº 1 construida en el año 1994, presentó un espesor del manto de la pluma en el área de aplicación del husillo, de 16 mm, en relación a los 22 mm de la Grúa Nº 2, construida el año 1998.   De igual forma, en el segmento inferior del manto de la pluma al que recibe el husillo, se detectó un espesor de 12 mm en relación a 16 mm, respectivamente.

La Autoridad Marítima Nacional DIRECTEMAR, en forma adelantada, advirtió a las empresas portuarias con grúas similares, que maximizaran las inspecciones de mantenimiento preventivo en busca de posibles fisuras y reportaran las fallas estructurales que hubiesen acontecido.

La nave sufrió daños en su cubierta principal y no tuvo responsabilidad en la génesis del accidente.

The engineer who was in the engine room control room at the time reported seeing smoke and some flames on the CCTV.

The port engine was immediately stopped and the starboard engine alternator started.  The engineer attempted to fight the fire on the port main engine but he was unable to control the fire with the hand held extinguisher.  It was decided to isolate the engine room, activate muster stations and shut down the port engine alternator.  The engine room was closed down quickly and the fixed CO2 system operated.  While smoke was still clearly visible on the CCTV monitor there were no flames.  The engineer and master agreed to inject the second shot of CO2 as a precaution.

The vessel berthed a very short time later and the fire brigade entered the engine room confirmed it was free of fire and was safe to enter.

On investigation it was found that one of the engine governor securing bolts had fractured causing the joint to open, allowing hot engine oil to spray onto the unlagged ""vee"" of the engine exhaust banks and ignite, causing the fire.

The engine was completely overhauled during late 2006 by the manufacturers.  Part of the overhaul was the removal and replacement of the governor.  All the indications suggest that the failed bolt was tightened to the incorrect torque causing it to fail.

The operating company has since completely lagged the exhaust system and added deflector plates to divert any oil leakage away form the lagged, hot exhaust pipes.

The intention was to load test progressively up to 31 tonnes using  water bags suspended from a certified wire and shackles supplied by the load test contractor.   However it was found that the load cell shackle pin would not fit through the hard eye of the supplied rope.    It was agreed by all parties to use a bowline knotted plasma rope of 70 t breaking strain to hang the water bag from the load cell shackle.   The water bag was lifted clear of the quayside and filling was commenced using a fresh water supply from the quay.  At a load between 10-12 tonnes the sheaves on test were inspected for any structural change.  None was found so filling of the water bag continued.  At a load of about 17 tonnes the rope failed and the water bag fell to the edge of the quay.  There was no damage and no injuries.

The introduction of the knotted rope into a tested lifting system caused the collapse.  Reference books state that the strength of a rope is reduced by at least 50% when knotted.  In this case the rope failed at about 25% of its breaking strain. 

The DPA has promulgated the lessons learnt and warned of the reduction in breaking starin when a knot is fitted to a system.

There were 4 main engines, No 1 engine was out of service for maintenance.  As the ferry left its French port No 3 main engine was shut down in accordance with normal procedures.  The crossing was then made on Nos 2 and 4 main engines.

The engineers attempted to start No 3 main engine when the ferry was about 3 miles from the UK port, but this was unsuccessful.  The master decided to abandon port entry when about 1.5 miles from the entrance. At one mile from the entrance No 4 main engine stopped and the master turned the ferry away from the port.  A short time later No 1 main engine, the final running engine stopped and a blackout occurred.  The emergency generator immediately came on line.  

The master then ordered a tug to assist and shortly afterwards let go of the port anchor, 5 shackles on deck.  An hour later the situation had not been resolved but 2 tugs were by now standing by.  The engineers managed to start one generator but at severely reduced power.  Breakers were operated to allow the generator to supply only the port winch motor.  The anchor was raised and the two tugs towed the ferry into port about one hour later.

The MCA surveyor and the company technical superintendent attended the vessel.  It was found that the low pressure air activated heavy fuel oil filters were defective.  The air from the actuator was pressurising the fuel bowl and forcing air into the fuel system.  It was believed that a fuel problem had occurred and the engineers cross connected the fuel systems.  This caused the air to be transferred into the other fuel system causing the cascade failure of the engines.

The engineers eventually discovered the faulty changeover cock and replaced the seals.

The engines were subsequently trialled with the technical superintendent and MCA surveyors present.  Trial included a one hour full power trial which was trouble free.

After making some adjustments to the second deck elevator landing door switches, the electrical technician stepped onto the ladder in the elevator shaft. He then asked the second engineer to let the doors close behind him. 

Soon after the doors closed, the elevator car travelled upwards and after a few seconds it stopped. 

The second engineer could not open the second deck elevator landing doors. He called the third engineer, on his hand held radio, and told him to come to the second deck. The two men tried, unsuccessfully, to open the elevator doors.

The two men then went upstairs and opened the upper deck elevator landing doors. They looked down and saw the electrical technician. He had been trapped by the elevator car and he appeared to be unconscious. Shortly afterwards, the second engineer activated the general alarm.

The master reported the accident to the refinery operator while the crew tried to free the electrical technician. 
Assistance arrived from ashore and, at about 19.20 hours LT, the refinery doctor examined the electrical technician and pronounced him dead.

The boat was brought up to the stowed position, but upon reaching the position the motor failed to stop when the operator tried to stop the winch.  The boat continued to be hoisted but the limit switches also failed to stop the hoist.  The winch continued to heave resulting in the winch mountings failing and the boat and winch falling into the water.

Upon investigation it was found that the limit switch was fully operational.  However one phase of the winch power supply contactor was still in the closed position causing the winch to continue to haul causing the boat to rise under the derrick head, this in turn caused the corroded winch base plate to part from the deck and the boat and winch toppled into the water.

The freeboard of the ballasted carrier LENA was approximately 11 metres so it was decided to rig the so-called ""combined accommodation/pilot ladder"". This comprises a classic rope ladder and a permanently installed gangway. One the rope ladder was rigged, the gangway was lowered to an angle of 40° so that its landing rests next to the rope ladder.

She sailed in ballast during the early evening of the 2 January 2007.  On exiting the Dutch River Berth the vessel suffered a main engine failure and the captain immediately ordered the anchor to be let go.  

The next 2 hours was spent on trying to restart the engine but this was unsuccessful.  It was initially suspected that the engine had suffered a fuel supply problem.  The electrical generators continued to function normally.  The harbour authorities decided that the vessel should move from the anchorage and the management company arranged for the vessel to be towed the short distance to the berth.

The vessel was attended by an engineer and MCA and Class surveyors the following morning.  The engine operates on a dry sump system.   It was found that the main engine oil charge was still in the engine sump and had not been transferred to the daily lube oil tank.  The engine stopped because the low lube oil pressure trip operated, thus protecting the engine.  Further investigation found that the lube oil scavenge pump was defective.  The pump was removed and overhauled by a local engineering company and refitted the following day.  The engine was successfully test run and the vessel sailed a short time later.
