Immediately the engine was put to about 70 rpm astern, but the ship proved to be securely aground with the bow about 130 m from Bn.18 on a heading of 243°.
The Master reported the grounding to the ship’s managers and the ASP Ship Management emergency plan was activated.
The ship was refloated the following morning with the assistance of tugs. Nobody was injured as a result of the grounding and no pollution resulted.
An inspection of the ship showed that it had sustained no material damage and the vessel was able to continue in service.

During the voyage to Isle of Man it was planned to carry out a density test on the condenser on starboard cooling system, which was considered routine work.

Before the test the cooling system should be separated from the remaining system and made gas free, because the system was cleaned with air under pressure and drained. The system was then considered gas free and the Chief mate started to build up the pressure in the condenser. When the pressure was 15 bar the Chief mate closed the valve and stopped the compressor.

He would then close the valve between the compressor and the condenser and at the time when he reached for the valve, an explosion happened and the compressor was torn into pieces and a fire broke out in the compressor room.

The Chief mate was knocked down and became temporary deaf. The Chief, who also was present, was hit by fragments. The crew started fire fighting and was approximately 2 hours later assisted by firemen from Plymouth. The ship sailed to Falmouth, the cargo was transferred to another ship, and the ship sailed to shipyard in Denmark for repair.

The bridge also began receiving telephone calls from crewmembers reporting smoke in various aft areas of the ship. Shortly thereafter, various sources, including a U.S. Coast guard (Coast Guard) watchstander who was monitoring marine traffic in the channel, observed a large amount of smoke issuing from the stern of the Ecstasy. In compliance with Coast Guard instructions, the ship‘s master ordered the passenger ship to proceed to an anchorage area; however, before reaching the anchorage, the Ecstasy lost propulsion power    and steering and began to drift. The master then radioed for assistance. A total of six tugboats responded to help fight the fire and to tow the Ecstasy. The fire was brought under control by onboard firefighters and was officially declared extinguished about 21:09 hours. Fourteen crewmembers and 8 passengers suffered minor injuries.","Passenger Ship","","70347","","","","","","","","","","","54","2","2008-12-11",""

The engines were stopped, the fuel supply shut off and the engine room battened down. A fire party attacked the seat of the fire with portable dry powder extinguishers, but as the party could not be certain the fire was fully extinguished, the halon system was activated. Two harbour tugs provided assistance in boundary cooling until a shore fire brigade party arrived on board. Members of the shore fire brigade party entered the engine room, and after a careful inspection, declared the fire to be fully extinguished.

The fire caused extensive damage to electrical wiring and fittings, resulting in Leonardo da Vinci being out of commission for three weeks. One person was injured in the incident receiving burns to the face and left forearm.

The ship was in ballast and was to load a cargo of petroleum products. Austral Salvor left her berth at white Island Tug Base at 16:35 hours and waited off Clara Rock for Barrington to approach. When Barrington was off Clara Rock, The tug approached the ship from astern on the port side. 
The tug approached within ten metres of the ship close to where she was to secure a line to the ship. The trainee tugmaster adjusted the tug’s speed to enable him to position the tug correctly off Barrington. While the tug was closing to the ship, he noticed the bow of the tug sheering to starboard towards the ship. The tug master took control of the tug and attempted to arrest the sheer. The sheer of the bow was halted, but the stern swung in and the tug rolled, making contact with the ship just above the waterline. The shell plating on Barrington was holed at the point of contact in way of the fuel oil storage tank, spilling fuel into the river.
The tug made fast to the ship at 16:50 and Barrington was secured to the berth at 17:36. Meanwhile, ship’s staff had reacted promptly transferring oil from the ruptured tank and were informed by the tug, at 17:30 hours,  that the leak had stopped. The port authorities had been alerted and initiated the port of Brisbane Oil Spill Contingency Plan.
Permanent repairs were carried out to the damaged area at a repair berth in Brisbane and the ship was able to load its cargo and proceeded on its new voyage shortly after the incident.

One of the deckhands was on watch in the wheelhouse and the steering was in the automatic mode.
The Panamanian bulk carrier Eternal Wind was proceeding due north at 13 knots, on passage from Port Kembla to Niihama, Japan, with a cargo of coal. At 08:00 hours, the 3rd Mate took over the watch from the Mate, who had instructed the AB watchkeeper to take temperature and atmosphere readings of the cargo hold. The wind was from the south-east at force 5, which was generating a moderate to rough sea on a low swell, and the visibility was good.
At 08:15 hours, the two ships collided, the bow planks of the fishing ship being sprung by the impact, causing the fishing ship to flood. Eternal Wind turned about to stand by Melina T, and took the four-man crew aboard when they had to abandon their ship.
Melina T sank at 10:27 hours and Eternal Wind diverted from its passage to land the four fishermen off Point Cartwright, where the men were disembarked to a water police launch. Eternal Wind then continued on its voyage to Japan.
The Master, officers and crew of Eternal Wind were interviewed when the ship loaded at Hay point, Queensland on the subsequent voyage.

The drill involved the launching of the port lifeboat with a crew of eight. 
The lifeboat was duly launched and, coxswained by the Mate; it cruised around the harbour for about ten minutes. After the lifeboat had returned and the boat's crew had hooked on the falls, the recovery party, under the charge of the 2nd Mate, found that the electric motor for the falls winch would not start. The Chief Engineer went to the motor contactor panel, located in the funnel, where he operated the falls winch motor by manually pushing in the contactor. He used a portable radio to maintain contact with the 2nd Mate. 
The lifeboat was hoisted by this method to deck level, where it was necessary to stop the hoisting while the boat's crew aligned the fall hooks with the davit heads. Hoisting was then resumed, in similar fashion, with all the eight men still in the boat. Despite a warning shout, the winch motor was not stopped before the davits brought up hard against the stops and the wire falls parted. The lifeboat fell to the water, turning over as it did so, spilling out most of the crew. 
A number of small leisure craft rushed to the scene rescued all eight crew members from the water and took them to the yacht club launching ramp. From there, ambulances took the crew members to Burnie hospital. 
All eight crew members suffered some form of injury, two suffered major bone fractures, but fortunately no one was killed. The lifeboat was extensively damaged.

The holding ground was considered to be good and the ship lay securely at anchor to the tides and westerly winds that predominated over the next six days. 

On 14 January, westerly winds of between 10 and 15 knots were experienced, dropping in the early evening to a gentle 5 knot westerly breeze. At about 22:25 hours, about one and half-hours before high water and with the ship lying to the tidal stream and heading north-east, a sudden squall was experienced at Broome generating storm force easterly winds. Within seconds, Carabao 1 started to drag anchor directly toward the outer berth. 

The Master, who was on watch, informed the engine room that he required the engine immediately, and called out the crew. The Chief Mate and Boatswain went forward to stand by the windlass. 

At about 22:28 hours, the ship's starboard bow, just aft of the anchor, came into contact with the eastern corner of the jetty. The ship, drifting rapidly in a westerly direction, was then driven through the moorings of local fishing ship. Four ships were damaged, one of which broke from its moorings and was driven beneath the jetty by the wind and tide. 

Between 22:30 and 22:35 hours, the anchor held once more and Carabao 1 came to a stop close to the shore. Soundings at the ship's stern showed that there was about one metre of water under the keel. 

By 22:45 hours the wind had dropped below 20 knots and the ship was able to recover its anchor at 23:18 hours and move clear of the small craft moorings. By this time the wind had dropped completely away and Carabao 1 anchored once more, 440 m off the outer berth. 

No one was injured as a result of this incident. In addition to the four smaller ships damaged, Broome jetty suffered some damage and Carabao 1 sustained an isolated indentation to its hull plating forward and some superficial paint damage.

As part of the inspection, the Surveyor requested that the engine of the free-fall lifeboat be started and the movement ahead and astern tested. The 3rd Engineer boarded the lifeboat, started the engine, operated it in the ahead and astern modes and, the test satisfactory, stopped the engine. The Surveyor then requested that the lifeboat’s rudder be operated, to port and to starboard. 
Standing on the lifeboat boarding platform, from where he could see into the lifeboat, the Surveyor observed the 3rd Engineer unsuccessfully try to turn a spoked wheel, aligned fore and aft adjacent to the coxswain’s seat. The 3rd Engineer then restarted the lifeboat engine, after which he again tried to turn the spoked wheel, this time with success. However, instead of the rudder turning, the lifeboat was launched, the 3rd Engineer being thrown to the bottom boards of the lifeboat. 
The ship’s rescue boat was launched, the lifeboat retrieved and taken alongside the wharf, where the 3rd Engineer was transferred to an ambulance. At Gladstone Hospital it was ascertained the 3rd Engineer had suffered a crush fracture of the first lumbar vertebra and concussion.
