Automatic fire/heat detection devices activated and alerted the crew.  Although the fire was contained inside the sauna room, the fixed water dry sprinkler system did not activate and the fire was extinguished manually. 

The safety investigation has concluded that the fire was caused by the placement of the women’s sauna wooden cedar floor grate on top of the frame work surrounding the sauna’s heating element/hot stones. 

An examination of the dry sprinkler pipe and check valve revealed that the latter was blocked in the closed position and did not open due to corrosion/oxidation of the valve seat. 

The safety investigation has also found that there were no specific maintenance records for the fixed dry sprinkler system in the sauna.","Passenger Ship","Ship remains fit to proceed","85920","Lloyd's Register (LR)","50384","","942","2582","0","","","","","","","2014-10-15",""

In-transit fumigation was planned to ensure cargo disinfestation by the time the vessel reaches her discharge port. 

During the afternoon, an explosion happened in cargo hold no. 4, followed by the escape of white smoke over the cargo deck area.  Further explosions occurred in other cargo holds. 

This culminated in a relatively violent explosion in cargo hold no. 2 at 1622.  Eventually, the situation was brought under control and temporary repairs enabled the vessel to continue on her voyage for repairs. 

The safety investigation concluded that the immediate cause of the explosions was an explosive mixture of phosphine and air.","Bulk Dry (general, ore) Carrier","Ship remains fit to proceed","39027","Lloyd's Register (LR)","74523","Solid cargo - Dry bulk","20","0","0","","","","","","","2014-10-15",""

The fixings that had originally secured the weed hatch cover had corroded and there was little to prevent water flooding in. Vixen sank quickly, around 50 m from the shore.
Five or six passengers donned life jackets and jumped out of the boat. One passenger, who was a weak swimmer, was not provided with a lifejacket, she and the skipper remained on board as the boat sank beneath them.  They were dragged underwater, but managed to swim back to the surface. Some of the passengers swam ashore, the remainder, and the skipper, were quickly rescued by a member of the public who was in another boat nearby.

It was being loaded at Westshore's Berth 2 by Friday afternoon. It will take longer for Berth 1 to become operational again. The crash knocked out power and water, in addition to leaving a 300-foot gap in the conveyer belt. Dykes said the conveyer had an emergency brake so minimal amounts of coal spilled into the water.

The atmosphere at the tops of the holds was tested before cargo discharge started. However, the fumigation sleeves were still in place and although a crew member later removed several sleeves; a number of sleeves were also discharged into the shore hoppers. An attempt was made to remove the fumigation sleeves from the hopper but at least one burst open. The shore side response to the spill included the bagging up of the sleeves that the crew member had removed. The bags, which had been placed on the deck, then began to smoke as phosphine gas was produced by the still active fumigant. The crew were evacuated to the quay and, as a precaution, some were taken to hospital. None were injured. It took several days for the fumigant to de-activate.

At around 1400, he placed a fire blanket over the gearbox and started to weld the crack on a ladder with the arc welding set. 

Whilst welding, he noticed a fire in the engine-room bilges below him.  Soon after, the fire alarm went off.  The crew members fought the fire using portable fire extinguishers.  The fire was extinguished in about 20 minutes.

Il travaille dans cette zone jusqu'au samedi 24 novembre sans problème particuliers, cependant, dans la nuit, la météo se dégrade très fortement: houle 6 mètres et vent de sud-ouest  de 25 nœuds.

vessel Island Panther made heavy contact with the transition piece
of turbine I-6 in the Sheringham Shoal Wind Farm at a speed of
about 12 knots. The impact caused the five persons on board to be
forced out of their seats and sustain various injuries. The structure
immediately aft of the vessel’s bow fender crumpled as a result of the
impact but no water ingress occurred.
During the day, Island Panther had been operating within the wind
farm transferring personnel from the floating hotel, Regina Baltica,
to various turbines situated in the wind farm. With bad weather
approaching, the master collected the personnel from their various
locations and had returned them all to Regina Baltica by 1536.
At 1750, Island Panther’s night master and deckhand joined the vessel from Regina Baltica
and a handover between the day and night masters commenced. At 1800, with the day
master still at the helm, Island Panther collected a passenger from Regina Baltica before
the night master took command.
The night master had to make passage through the wind farm to follow the approved route
back to Wells-next-the-Sea. It was dark, the wind was gusting 25-30 knots with driving
rain from the west-north-west, and there was 1.5m of swell from the south-east. The south
cardinal buoy light on the south side of the wind farm was visible, as were the rows of
turbine aviation safety lights. The master steered Island Panther towards the south cardinal
buoy light, glancing at the chart plotter in front of him, at a reduced speed of 11-12 knots
because of the sea conditions.
At 1811, Island Panther made heavy head-on contact with the unlit transition piece of a
turbine. The impact forced everyone out of their seats. The passenger sustained a head
injury but remained conscious and was tended to by one of the crew. The vessel was
assessed for damage before slowly heading out of the wind farm. Two other passenger
transfer vessels stood by and the vessel was met off Wells fairway buoy by two lifeboats.
Having decided it was safer to keep the casualties on board, once there was sufficient tidal
height, Island Panther entered the harbour and was met by shore emergency services.","","Ship remains fit to proceed","21.72","","","","","","","0","0","0","4","1","0","2017-03-17",""

injuries.
At 1620, Windcat 9 left Lynn and Inner Dowsing Wind Farm, situated
2.7 nautical miles off Skegness. On board were two crew (master
and a deckhand), a supernumerary (trainee master) and 12 wind
farm technicians. The vessel was on autopilot and the master
was following a reciprocal course on his chart plotter to that of his
outbound passage. At about 1650, the master was demonstrating to the trainee master how
to adjust the plotter’s range. In doing so he inadvertently moved the route, which took the
vessel to within 0.75 cable of an unlit floating target.
The master, believing he was still on his reciprocal route, then applied port helm to get
ahead of Fastnet Tern, another vessel returning to Grimsby. A short time later, he made
another course correction, this time to starboard after he belatedly realised he was
significantly to the west of the planned track. About 30 seconds later, while proceeding
at 23.5 knots, Windcat 9’s port hull made contact with the target. Following the master’s
distress alert radio transmission, a number of vessels came to his aid. Soon afterwards, the
passengers and crew were transferred to Fastnet Tern.","","Ship rendered unfit to proceed","31.12","","","","","","","","","","","","","2017-03-17",""

On 12 November evening after the vessel anchored, deck and engine officers maintained anchor watches. 

On 13 November at 0300hrs, motorman on duty, opened main engine scavenging space manholes on order from 1ST Engineer. At 0600hrs the ventilation of scavenging space was commenced by the duty motorman.

At 0730hrs, 13 November tool box meeting was held which was supervised by Chief Engineer and attended by available watch ratings, all engineers including engine cadet and wiper. First Engineer intended to make scavenging port inspection at anchorage due to time constraints and many other jobs in hand to be carried out while the vessel in port alongside discharging berth.   

Understanding that the scavenging port inspection would not take much time, Chief Engineer permitted for the job although port permit was not requested for immobilization of main engine as vessel was at anchor. 

Chief engineer, Second and Third engineers, with assistance of deck crew, started other machinery work on deck.  

By 1030hrs, the First Engineer completed preparations to enter scavenging space. He carried with him the turning gear remote control and a torch light. On reaching M.E. unit #1 he adjusted with remote control the piston position, began inspecting and taking photos of piston rings, crown and cylinder liner. After completing inspection of #1 unit in about 10mins time, he came out from 1st unit. 

At this time Engine Cadet came to First Engineer and expressed his desire to observe and learn the scavenging space inspection procedures. First Engineer accepted Cadet’s request and along with him started to inspect #2 unit.  He then adjusted the position of the piston, using remote control, to bring it below scavenging port at BDC. When the piston reached at BDC 1st Engineer handed over the remote control of turning gear to Cadet and instructed him to release the screw mounted on the improvised switch, which was required so that movement of the piston could be stopped that was going upwards. 

Cadet was not familiar with the remote control switch as he was handling this remote control of turning gear first time. Being uncertain and unsure the Cadet started slowly releasing the screw fitted on remote switch of turning gear. 
By this time 1ST Engineer anticipating that the Cadet would release the screw and stop the moving piston, he placed both his hands inside the scavenging port of #2unit of main engine, holding a camera in his hands. He concentrated and focused to take photos of cylinder liner while the piston continued moving upwards. The Cadet till this time could not completely release the switch which would stop the movement of the piston. 

The upward moving piston was not noticed by 1ST Engineer and eventually his both hands were caught between moving piston and cylinder liner at the upper edge of scavenging port and disintegrated from both wrists. This incident took place around 1048hrs.

Cadet managed to stop the movement of the piston but by this time 1ST Engineer’s both hands were severely injured and he was not able to move from place. Cadet informed about the incident to other engine crew who called for immediate help.                    

Some times later other Engineers rushed to the location along with ratings. Chief Engineer, moved the piston down using remote control switch, a little below upper edge of scavenge port and set free both hands of the casualty. 

The ship’s crew carried injured 1st Engineer from engine room to ship’s hospital on stretcher where first aid was provided to him.

2 hours later a generator and the bow thruster were started. Nevertheless, all the hawsers broke 3 hours later and the ship began to move away from her berth (Poste 116). The shore supply connection tore off  and the generator stopped. The vessel was now adrift in the basin without her main engine and moving toward another berth (Poste 40). She collided with it, but thanks to the assistance of 2 tugs, she was then secured and maintained alongside.

The main engine compartments began to be flooded. The pumping was started but was not enough effective. 1 hour later, due to the impossibility to reach the flooded compartments, a shore pumping operation was not yet possible. In the following hours the vessel grounded by the aft and various plan of salvage were assessed.","Passenger / Ro-Ro Cargo Ship","Ship rendered unfit to proceed","44307","Bureau Veritas (BV)","3336","","3","0","1","","","","","","","2015-05-29",""

The aft tug appeared to be pushing with more power than the forward tug and the drection of the wind seemed to further push the vessel's aft towards the port. As a result of this unevenly distributed push, the vessel's main engine storage tank from the vessel's starboard side contacted the port. This caused damage to the storage oil tank and crew members had to immediately transfer the lube oil from the main engine storage tank to the No. 1 cyl. oil tank. During the course of this transfer, however, the vessel discharged about 16,600 liters of system lube oil into the sea.

After taking over the watch, the navigational officer of the watch (OOW) sat down on the starboard wheelhouse chair and subsequently fell asleep. 

There was no look-out during the watch and with the OOW fast asleep, the vessel maintained course and speed practically with an unmanned bridge.  Wilson Newport passed two consecutive way points for course alteration at the Straits of Kea Island.  At about 06151 1 Unless otherwise stated, all times referred to in this report are ships time (UTC+2). , the vessel ran aground off the South-East coast of Agios Georgios Islet, which is located about 15 nautical miles South of Cape Sounio. 

The area where Wilson Newport ran aground was a rocky shoreline.  Consequently, the vessel sustained damages in way of double bottom tanks nos. 1 port and starboard, the bow thruster room, the forepeak tank and two other ballast tanks.  There were no reported injuries or pollution as a result of the occurrence. 

The salvage operations commenced on the morning of 23 October 2012 and the appointed salvors were able to refloat the vessel during the afternoon of the following day.","General Cargo Ship","Ship rendered unfit to proceed","6118","Germanischer Lloyd (GL)","8321","Solid cargo - Dry bulk","10","0","0","","","","","","","2014-10-15",""

However, the system was not completely isolated and he suffered an electric shock, resulting in second and third degree burns in three of his fingers. 

The safety investigation concluded that the engine rating was unaware that other parts of the system were still live.

Although direct first aid could be rendered the seafarer died of his wounds shortly thereafter.
An investigating on-scene was conducted by the vessel management to identify the underlying grounds of the accident. The objective was to reveal weak spots within the work safety procedures in the first place. The company Safety Management System (SMS) was found to provide all pertinent precautionary measures to safeguard the works of the seafarers while performing their tasks on the vessel.

Beside the commitment as per the Casualty Code to conduct a safety investigation into every very serious marine casualty the flag State chief casualty investigator has decided to initiate a full independent investigation into this fatality. The aim is to find out if the whole process of the company SMS is managed effectively or if cursory habitual practise on board of Kampen may possibly cause handling failures.
As per Chapter 20 of the Casualty Investigation Code parties involved in the commencement of the investigation have been informed with a relevant notification.

The
ferry was on a scheduled, regular, westbound crossing of Sunda strait. The passage would be
made at its usual speed of about 10 knots2 and would take about 2 hours. The master, the
chief mate and a helmsman were on the ferry’s bridge. After the vessel was full away, the
master left the bridge. Meanwhile, Norgas Cathinka was approaching Sunda strait from the
south on a northeasterly course. The chief mate and a helmsman were on the bridge.
At 0420, Norgas Cathinka was on a heading of 049 True (T) and a speed of about 12 knots. At
the time, three eastbound radar targets on Norgas Cathinka’s port bow were detected.
Following that, two more vessels on west-northwest courses were also detected. These two
vessels were later identified as Bahuga Jaya and Gelis Rauh.
At 0436, the last of the eastbound vessel, identified as MV Caitlyn crossed Norgas Cathinka’s
bow at a distance of about 1 nautical mile (Nm)3. Bahuga Jaya was still on a collision course
with Norgas Cathinka on a bearing of about 074 (T).
At about 0440, Norgas Cathinka’s chief mate decided to take action to avoid collision. Using
the autopilot, he adjusted the heading order to 050 (T). At about the same time, Bahuga
Jaya’s chief mate also decided to take action to avoid collision. He ordered port 20 and the
helmsman executed his order.
At 0441, Norgas Cathinka’s heading was 055 (T) and turning to 060 (T) as set on the
autopilot.
At about 0442½, Bahuga Jaya’s chief mate ordered hard to port. Norgas Cathinka was less
than half a mile ahead. By this time, Norgas Cathinka’s chief mate had changed to hand
steering mode and turned the wheel to starboard to alter course more quickly.
At 0443, Norgas Cathinka’s heading was 066 (T) and turning to starboard i.e. towards the
east. Bahuga Jaya was 3 cables directly ahead of the vessel and turning quickly to port,
towards the east. The two vessels were closing rapidly at a speed where they would meet in
about 1 minute.
At 0443¼, Bahuga Jaya’s chief mate made an attempt to contact Norgas Cathinka on VHF
radio channel 16. He called the vessel’s name three times, using ‘Bahasa4’, but did not
receive any response.
Norgas Cathinka’s chief mate was still at the steering stand and he did not understand the
radio call. At 0443¾, with Bahuga Jaya about 100 m away, he turned the wheel hard over to
starboard.

At 0444¼, Norgas Cathinka’s heading was 135 (T) and turning quickly to starboard. A few
seconds later, the Norgas Cathinka’s port bow collided with Bahuga Jaya’s starboard side,
aft of the bridge. At 0444½, aware of the collision, Gelis Rauh made a distress (Mayday) call
on VHF radio channel 16.
At 05.25, the AIS of Bahuga Jaya no longer appeared in Norgas Cathinka’s radar display. The
vessel sank in position 05 52.764 S/105 51.108 E, in water about 79 m deep.
At 05.30, after moving 5 Nm from the collision position, Norgas Cathinka returned to the
collision position and soon dropped its anchor in the area.
The collision resulted Bahuga Jaya heel to port and then continuing until it capsized. There
were 10 ferries approaching the collision site and assisting the survivors. Later Search and
Rescue operation found 206 survivors and 7 fatalities. Norgas Cathinka suffered minor
damage to her bow structure.
Investigation report identifies that assumption were made on both vessels. Bahuga Jaya
assumed that no course alteration was made by Norgas Cathinka. Hence the chief mate took
action by turning to port i.e. towards Norgas Cathinka. This is not consistent with the
regulations for preventions of collision at sea (COLREGs).

At 2240, the off-loading of the vehicles commenced almost as soon as the ship’s bow ramp unfolded and landed on the shore linkspan.  Two propulsion power thrusters used in manoeuvring Malita alongside were set on bridge control and positioned in the direction of the quay to keep her alongside during the mooring operation.  The shipside door-ramp had yet to be lowered for passengers to disembark. 

At about 2241, without any warning, the bow ramp and the vessel gathered sternway.  As the vessel started to move astern and away from the shore linkspan, the head rope parted.  The bosun, who was stationed at the bow ramp, immediately informed the master and started the process of closing the ramp.  By the time the movement of the vessel could be arrested, the ramp had slid to the edge of the shore linkspan, and rested on the ledge.  As a result of this movement, the four hinged flaps lifted almost perpendicular to the shore linkspan.  Three motor vehicles that were being driven off the ramp at the time were caught by the flaps.  The occupants of the motor vehicles suffered no physical injuries although they had been reported to be in a state of shock.  One passenger was eventually taken to hospital to receive medical assistance. 

An internal investigation was conducted by the Company, and a number of safety actions had been taken to prevent a similar future accident.
 
The Marine Safety Investigation Unit concluded that the failure of the mooring rope was the extraordinary strain on the head rope from the thrusters’ power.  Based on the findings of the safety investigation, and taking into consideration the safety actions by the Company, three recommendations have been issued, aimed to address loading and off-loading of motor vehicles and the safety of mooring operations.","Passenger / Ro-Ro Cargo Ship","Ship remains fit to proceed","4893","DNV AS (DNV)","1100","Solid cargo - Roll-on/Roll-off","15","126","0","","","","","","","2014-10-15",""

The ship’s anchoring position could not be corrected on time.  The propulsion engine suffered a failure and could not be put into operation, causing a delay.
The port’s tugs which were deployed to the site to provide assistance, could not carry out the maneuver due to the heavy sea and shallow waters.

Durante la noche su ancla garreó  debido a las fuertes marejadas que afectaban el sector, encallando en una playa de arena, denominada LLo-Lleo.
La nave no logró corregir oportunamente su débil posición de fondeo y al tratar de poner en funcionamiento su motor propulsor este presentó fallas, demorando su puesta en servicio.
Los remolcadores del puerto que concurrieron a prestar ayuda no pudieron pasar los remolques debido al fuerte oleaje y al poco fondo del sector en que se desarrollaba la emergencia.
El MRCC Chile coordinó medios de salvamento, evacuando a la totalidad de la dotación por medio de helicópteros de la Armada de Chile.

 At 1607 (UTC+1) on 14 August 2012, Mr X, an experienced recreational diver, fell onto the deck of the dive workboat Jean Elaine.  When he fell, Mr X was fully dressed and prepared for diving to a depth of 95m; he was wearing heavy equipment on his back and had additional diving gear attached to his front and sides. Although it was not immediately apparent, it was likely that the diving gear impacted into his abdomen during the fall and caused significant internal injuries. Having been helped back to his feet by the boat’s crew, Mr X made a positive indication that he wished to continue with the dive and he entered the water unaided. At a depth of 88m, he started an unplanned return to the surface. He lost control of his breathing and buoyancy shortly afterwards. Three of his fellow divers attempted to increase his buoyancy and administer breathing gases; however, Mr X did not start breathing again. He was attached to a lifting bag and ascended to the surface from a depth of 65m. Despite further medical treatment on board Jean Elaine and by the emergency services, he could not be revived and was pronounced dead later that evening.

Having waited at German Bight anchorage, where ship had arrived from Hound Point, UK, the vessel weighed her anchor on 13th August  for a piloted river transfer up to Wilhelmshaven Germany. All pre departure checks and tests had been carried out and found in good order before the anchor was weighed and due to the fact that the vessel was at anchor for more than 24 hours, the crew were well rested. Cargo on board was 87230 tonnes of crude oil, draft was 13.45m meters, even keel. During transit from anchorage to Wilhelmshaven the vessel's movements were tracked and monitored by the VTS in the area, first German Bight Traffic and later Jade Traffic. Pilot had also requested radar control from ashore, intending to take every precaution for a safe transit up the river. This service is normal practice when transiting up to Wilhelmshaven with a deep draft vessel. Visibility was good during the transit. During the first two (2) hours of the passage, the tide was rising and vessel adjusted it's speed. All the way to the starboard buoy no 17 during this voyage, the prepared voyage plan was followed. The vessel navigated safely in the German Bight traffic area towards the river Jade. However after the starboard buoy no 17, the vessel was on the starboard side of the fairway. Jade Traffic had at this point, acknowledged the deviation and informed the vessel. When the vessel turned at starboard buoy no 19, the steering course was given as 165 ° and shortly corrected to 160 ° to compensate for the setting by the current which had been against m/t Katja during her passage proceeding in the river Jade. After the turn the current came more in from port side and affected the vessel far more than expected. The vessel slowly slid to the bottom of the river and finally ran aground between buoy 19 and 21. It was later confirmed by the Chief officer that there were no injuries, pollution and that there was no ingress of water in ballast tanks and cargo tank ullages were unchanged. The ship initially tried to use its own engine astern and ahead and rudder movements from port to starboard in order to refloat the vessel. This attempt however failed but vessel later refloated with tug assistance on 14th August and resumed passage to Wilhelmshaven.

De nombreux passagers sont projetés sur l’avant et seize d’entre eux sont  légèrement blessés.  Après s’être assuré de l’absence de voie d’eau et du bon fonctionnement de la propulsion et de la barre, le capitaine envisage dans un premier temps de débarquer ses passagers au port des Hôpitaux.
Il prend en définitive la décision de regagner le port d’Erquy proche du lieu de l’incident et informe les passagers de la situation. Le CROSS Corsen n’est pas informé.
Le matelot et un médecin présent à bord prodiguent les premiers soins aux blessés.
Le capitaine avise par téléphone son armateur puis le CODIS 22.

Neuf blessés sont évacués sur les hôpitaux de Saint-Brieuc et Dinan et un blessé est évacué par hélicoptère sur l’hôpital de Saint-Brieuc. Les six autres sont traités sur place.
Après consultations toutes les autres personnes regagnent leur domicile. Une plongée effectuée plus tard permettra de constater une déformation au niveau du « saumon » tribord.

Le 28 Juillet 2012 en début de matinée, le vent du sud-est pour environ 20 nœuds génère une houle de 205 m. Vers 9 :00, à la position 02°55’S/055°01’E, le navire largue son skiff pour effectuer un coup de senne sur un DCP (dispositif concentrateur de poissons). Vingt minutes après commence le relevage de la senne.
Pendant le virage de la senne, au cours d’une manœuvre destinée à positionner le navire par rapport au filet, la remorque du skiff, qui est frappée sur un anneau fixe sur l’AR du pavois tribord, déforme la tape horizontale d’accès au local barre. Dans ce local sont aussi entreposées des pièces (des cartes électroniques) particulièrement sensibles à l’humidité.
Averti, le chef mécanicien  décide d’intervenir. Il se rend sur place accompagné du second et du troisième mécanicien. Les deux officiers mécaniciens vont chercher des outils tandis qu’il reste sur Place.
Au même moment, le skiff commence à tirer. Pendant  cette manœuvre ; il passe de tribord vers bâbord. La remorque balaye l’arrière du thonier et frappe le chef mécanicien à la poitrine.
A son retour, quelque minutes plus tard, le second mécanicien trouve le chef inanimé sur le pont. Il donne l’alerte.
Malgré les soins qui lui sont prodigués immédiatement, l’équipage ne parvient pas à le ranimer. Il décède peu après.
Le capitaine décide alors de faire route sur le port de Mahé au Seychelles où le Torre Giulia arrivera le lendemain en milieu de journée.

The vessel was fully laden and was also carrying dangerous cargo. 

On 20 July at 1300 (LT), the second engineer, who was on his way to the forecastle deck, observed smoke from one of the containers stowed in Bay 34 (Figure 1).  The master was immediately informed and took control of the situation. 

At the time, the vessel was in the Red Sea in position 24° 42.0’N  036° 11.3’E.  She was on a course of 330°(T), making 19.5 knots.  The air temperature was 40°C whilst the sea temperature was 33°C. 

As there was neither any activity nor hot work in the vicinity of Bay 34, the reason for the smoke was not immediately apparent. 
 
The master immediately altered the vessel’s course to avoid wind blowing smoke in the direction of the ship’s accommodation.  He also reduced speed and instructed the chief mate to check the stowage plan and identify the container. 

The chief mate determined that the source of smoke and fire was Container ZIMU 1046577 with a Class 4.2 - UN 3341 cargo. 

The safety investigation concluded that the most likely cause of the fire and smoke was an exothermic decomposition of thiourea dioxide cargo. 

One recommendation was made to Transport Malta, aimed to raise awareness on the potential hazards associated with the carriage of this cargo.","Container Ship","Ship remains fit to proceed","40030","DNV AS (DNV)","50842","Solid cargo - Containers","22","0","0","","","","","","","2014-10-15",""

This cargo was destined for La Plata. 
To safeguard this cargo for getting shifted while the vessel was in transit beside standard lashing and securing some construction parts were partly secured by steel stoppers and lashing rings welded on deck.
To discharge the cargo this securing stoppers and securing bolts had to be grinded off the steel plates on which they were welded. To do this job, a landside company was instructed by the vessel’s charterer. When the workers of this company approached the vessel, the chief mate showed the foreman the work to be done without verifying any authorization and hot work permit issuance. While doing the job, a fire broke out during which three of the working gang were injured and one died in the cargo hold where the fire had started. There was no bodily harm to any crew. All hands were saved through effective cooperation with landside fire brigades and rescue resources.

The flag State marine safety investigation Authority has initiated a full casualty investigation into this very serious marine casualty as per Chapter 6 of the Casualty Code.

At the time of the accident, Aruni Rickmers was on anchor in the South Outer Harbour, Busan.

Blue Angel had sailed from Luoyuan, China in ballast on 10 July 2012 for Busan. The plan was to take bunkers before proceeding to Tacoma, USA. End of sea passage was logged on 12 July 2012 at 09:48 hrs. Her destination was South Outer Harbour. Busan VTS has directed the ship to drop her anchor in N4 Anchorage Area.
However, upon anchoring at 11:20 hrs, Busan VTS instructed the master to relocate her anchorage as it was deemed to be very close to Aruni Rickmers.
While weighing up the anchor, the master ordered engines on ""dead slow astern"" but found himself in close quarter situation with a bunker-barge supplying bunkers to a ship astern of Blue Angel. In quick successions, the master ordered ""dead slow ahead"", ""slow ahead"", and ""full ahead"" on the main engine in order to clear the bunker barge. However, this manoeuvre brought Blue Angel even closer to Aruni Rickmers. A subsequent ""hard to starboard"" helm and various engine movements were not sufficient enough to clear her from Aruni Rickmers.

At 11:30 hrs, Blue Angel made heavy contact with Aruni Rickmers in position 35° 02.21'N  129° 03.64E, in the N4 Anchorage Area. Aruni Rickmers sustained minor damage to her bulbous bow.
However, Blue Angel suffered extensive hull damage.
Although there were no reported injuries or pollution, her port side shell plating in way of cargo hold no. 3 was punctured and a number of side shell plating, frames and brackets were either deformed or dented.
It was concluded that the immediate cause of the accident was Blue Angel's anchoring in very close proximity of Aruni Rickmers. Two safety recommendations were made to the managers of the ship with the scope of addressing the hazards related to anchorage in waiting areas.

At midnight, the second mate relieved the third mate from the navigational watch.  The vessel was on autopilot steering 083°.  At 0020, the second mate noticed that the vessel was deviating from the planned course and set the autopilot on a new heading of 086°.  Subsequently, he sat down on the bridge chair and shortly afterwards he fell asleep.  The navigational officer was alone on the bridge and no look-out was posted. 

As Flash approached the next way point, North of Ile de la Galite, the current started to set her south in the direction of Galitons de l'est.  Just before 0100, the Electronic Chart Display and Information System's alarm sounded.  The officer of the watch, however, remained asleep.  When he woke up a few minutes before grounding, it was already too late to reduce speed or change course.  At 0353, Flash ran aground and remained stranded on the rocky shoals of Galitons de l'est in position
37° 33.69'N  008° 57.17'E. 

The vessel sustained extensive damage in the fore and bottom part of the hull but there were no resulting injuries and pollution. 

The MSIU safety investigation highlighted several safety issues, which contributed to the grounding including: 
    
The officer of the watch had become increasingly fatigued.  He had been working for over eight months without a break and had adopted a sleep pattern where he would normally not sleep before the midnight watch; 
No dedicated look-out was posted.  The officer of the watch was alone on the bridge when he fell asleep; 
The master's instructions to post a look-out only when deemed necessary, without regard to the Company's safety management system and relevant international requirements, caused ambiguity and confusion to the officer of the watch. 

Taking into consideration the safety actions already taken by the Company, one recommendation has been made with the scope of ensuring that OOWs make best use of the hours of rest in order to ensure that they are fit to take over the watch.","Bulk Dry (general, ore) Carrier","Ship remains fit to proceed","91373","American Bureau of Shipping (ABS)","177996","Solid cargo - Dry bulk","24","0","0","","","","","","","2014-10-15",""

Prior to the collision, SPRING GLORY, loaded with 80,400 mt iron ore, navigated eastbound on the course 046° at a speed of 10.4 knots and had just l eft the traffic separation scheme (TSS) of the Singapore Strait. JOSEPHINE MÆRSK, loaded with general cargo in containers many of which were refrigerated containers, navigated westbound and was about to enter the TSS of the Singapore Strait. According to the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, SPRING GLORY was the ship to give way, and JOSEPHINE MÆRSK was the ship to stand on. The officer of the watch on SPRING GLORY had, on its radar, noticed JOSEPHINE MÆRSK approaching on a crossing course about 10 minutes prior to the collision. However, options for drastic ship manoeuvres were limited because of the traffic situation so the officer of the watch hesitated and waited for actions to be taken by JOSEPHINE MÆRSK to avoid a collision. During the last minutes prior to the collision, he attempted to communicate with JOSEPHINE MÆRSK, and when he finally took an evasive action by giving helm hard to port, it was too late to avoid a collision. The officer of the watch on JOSEPHINE MÆRSK observed visually SPRING GLORY approaching at a distance of approx. 2 nm on a crossing course, about five minutes prior to the collision. During the time until the collision, he confirmed his observation by the use of binoculars, answered briefly calls from SPRING GLORY ascertaining the identity of that ship, found the distance between the ships on the radar, checked his own position on the GPS and plotted it into the chart. He misunderstood a message on the VHF to increase the speed that was actually meant for another ship and that contributed to him not conducting any effective manoeuvre in due time. He called the master for assistance and took an evasive action by giving helm hard to starboard; however, too late to avoid a collision. The collision caused damage to both ships and to the cargo of JOSEPHINE MÆRSK. In JOSEPHINE MÆRSK a fire in the electrical installations of some refrigerated containers was caused by the collision. No one was injured and there was no pollution of the environment.

The cargo supervisor and stevedores boarded the vessel at noon. They were checked at gangway by ship’s crew in compliance to ISPS code. 

Chief Officer advised cargo supervisor about the cargo stowage and associated health hazards of cargo. Cargo in # 2 and 4 hold was for Qingdao port while #1, 3 and 5 for 2nd discharge port, Nantong. 

Cargo discharging from #2 and #4 holds commenced on 18 May afternoon using shore cargo gears and continued till 0600hrs on 19 May 2012. At the end of shift stevedores disembarked the vessel. 

At 0700hrs, stevedores of next shift boarded the vessel and their security check carried out at the gangway. Cargo in #2 hold middle area had reached tank top levels hence labor was deployed for sweeping and collecting cargo to continue discharging.

The ship crew had kept the hatch entrance covers of #1, 3 and 5 closed with wing nuts screwed tight but their lids were not locked.

All the 3 victims were taken out from cargo hold and transported to hospital by port ambulance. At the time of shifting 3 labors to ambulance, 2 were unconscious but breathing, unlike of 3rd labor.
The investigation of accident revealed the following: 
•	Lack of supervision by In-charge of Stevedores, their lack of familiarity with ship’s lay out and lack of training in identification of warning sign and posters used on board ships. 

•	Stevedores’ incapability in deciphering instructions in English, not understanding markings on hatch entrance and their inattentive, inobservant and careless approach  while entering cargo hold #3

•	Ship’s crew failure in securing all not – to – be - discharged hatches in that port.

•	Lack of communication and instructions by ship’s crew to stevedore regarding dangerous properties of cargo in absence of thorough ventilation

On 29 April she docked port side at berth #1 to load cargo i.e. salt bags for Indonesia. 
The vessel has 2 hatches with 8 panels and fitted with 2 sets of derricks each. 
On 04 May at 11:45hrs, the vessel commenced loading salt bags in #2cargo hold. By 5th morning 592mt of cargo was loaded in the same and draft recorded was 1.50m forward and 4.90m aft. 
On 05 May, Second Officer was OOW in port from midnight till morning 06:00hrs. By this hrs #1hatch was to be opened for cargo loading as the stevedores were to resume work at 06:00hrs. 
At 05:30hrs, Second Officer gave wake up call to Chief Officer, Boson and AB. 10 minutes later, Chief Officer along with Second Officer, Boson and two ABs, started rigging up derrick #1 for opening hatch #1 manually because of its non-functional hydraulic motor. Post necessary hatch panels arrangements and checks for manual operation on hatch panels, the crew were to come down to monitor safe opening of hatch cover. Chief Officer and an AB were to be on starboard side and 2nd Officer with another AB on port side. All crew members came down and took their positions on main deck but the AB  stood on #1 derrick crutch post bracket attached to hatch track way on port side. 
Boson pulled the pull wire using derrick #1 and the hatch panels began to open. The AB  standing on derrick parking boom bracket lost his balance and fell on #1 panel. Before he could stand and jump on main deck he got trapped between 1st and 2nd panel on parking track way (stowage bay). 
When 2nd Officer and Bosun saw the AB between the panels, the opening operation was stopped. The wire was then rigged to close hatch cover by pulling # 1 panel to rescue the victim. He was then drawn out and laid on a stretcher. Incidentally the Port ambulance was in the vicinity and its driver on seeing the commotion of accident parked the vehicle near to ship’s gangway. The casualty was immediately transported to port hospital by the ambulance where he was declared dead. 
The report concludes that during hatch cover opening operation the inappropriate positioning of AB on the derrick boom crutch post bracket at a very close distance to hatch track and his momentary loss of concentration were the main cause of the accident.

The turning manoeuvre in the Siechenbucht (turning basin) necessary for this failed because the two pod propulsors were still being operated in “Sea mode”. Because only one hydraulic pump was activated per propulsor, instead of two. The ship’s command was unable to stop in the turning basin and the ferry headed towards the opposite pier at a speed over ground of 6.51 kts. The Danish ferry URD, whose crew was occupied with making proparations for the scheduled voyage to Liepaja, was made fast there at pier. Most of the passengers and the cargo were already on board. 
The collision occurred at 18:14 hrs. The port side of the URD was pressed in by the bow of the Nils Holgersson, causing the URD to take on water and heel to port. It was possible to stabilise the ship by flooding the forward ballast water tanks, which enabled the evacuation of people and much of the cargo via stern ramp.
The Nils Holgersson was able to move to her berth under her own power after the controls were switched to harbour mode.
Nobody came to physical harm and the environment was not damaged due to the collision.

The accident occurred en route from Burgtiefe, Fehmarn during a training voyage to the Danish port of Bagenkop (Langeland).

The accident happened at the beginning of the voyage. At the time of the accident, the sailing yacht was located close to the shoreline some 2 nm south of the port of Burgstaaken (Fehmarn).

Problems were experienced with the mainsail due to inattentiveness during a turning manoeuvre. The main sheet had run out to the mast; the skipper then went on the starboard side and the assistant skipper on the port side forward to the mast to clear the ends of the mainsheet. 

While making his way back from the bow, the assistant skipper fell overboard; however, he was still holding onto one end of the sheet and therefore did not lose contact with the sailing yacht. Two or three other sailors were able to keep the man-overboard at the side of the ship at about amidships by holding onto his hands and the inflated lifejacket. In an attempt to pull him back on board, the lifejacket was pulled upward over the head of the man in the water. When the attempt to haul the casualty on deck amidships failed, he was pulled to the stern, where they tried in vain to assemble a folding bathing ladder, which was not fixed to the hull. The skipper secured himself to the backstay with a safety line/lifebelt and tried to recover the casualty by reaching for his hands from the improperly mounted ladder. One of the ladder joints broke during this recovery attempt, and the skipper fell overboard, too. Hauling him back on deck proved difficult. During this recovery attempts the casualty drifted away and in spite of the Special One executing several manoeuvres, it was no possible to re-establish contact with the lifeless person floating in the water.

After the skipper was back on deck, he went below deck, transmitted a distress alert and then used the VHF radio for the distress communications.

The fishing trawler Tümmler was near the scene of the accident and became aware of the emergency at 10:27 hrs due to the radio traffic. Her crew managed to establish a line connection with the lifeless person floating in the water. However, the crew of the fishing trawler did not manage to recover and lift the body on deck, either. The person was only recovered with considerable difficulty at about 10:53 by the crew of the inflatable dinghy belonging to the Fehmarn police boat and then taken to the port of Burgstaaken on Felmarn. The casualty was pronounced dead by the summoned emergency doctor at the port.

At 12:46 hours the skipper decided to change the position. During heaving up the anchor he engaged the motor some bits ahead just to help the maneuver with the intention of releasing the tension of the anchor line and let ease the rope. The headway proved to be excessive, as the vessel followed her way and the rope entangled with the propeller, due to which the propeller was blocked, shutting down the main engine. When propulsion ran out , the ship kept stern to the current. No crew went down to the engine room to check for any major breakdown. The skipper went to the bridge to contact the hospital ship (B / H) ESPERANZA DEL MAR and request help, when he observed through the access hatch to the engine room that it was flooded. The skipper decided to leave the ship communicating it to B / H ESPERANZA DEL MAR and sending a distress call to the ships in the area by VHF on channel 16. The eight crew members of the B / P NEW FRANCISCO JAVIER jumped from ship into liferafts being rescued later by two Polish flag factory vessels and moved to the vicinity of the bay of Cabo Blanco, where authorities collected to land them in Puerto Artesano. The B / P NEW FRANCISCO JAVIER was afloat broadcasting its position automatically through the ""blue box"" until the day April 26, 2012 at 02:51 hours, being in the position l = 20 02 ', 96 N, L = 017 26 ', 68 W, 35 miles to 198 from the point where the accident occurred. On June 30, 2012, after more than two months after the accident, the tanker Marshall Islands flag B / T CAPE BANTRY informed services Maritime Rescue and Canary Navarea coordinator II, in France, the sighting of a boat adrift at 11:10 am in position l = 10 17 ', 7 N, L = 033 00', 6 W, later it was confirmed that she was the B / P NEW FRANCISCO JAVIER. The vessel was in apparent relative good condition. (See the Figure 2 in the attached Report). No Recommendations were rised because most of issues were a matter of law enforcement and such items are out of the scope of the Directive.","Fish Catching Vessel","Total loss of the ship","36.49","","","","8","0","0","","","","","","","2019-11-19",""

After discharging the project cargo, a local company started to flame cut the left over parts of the already removed stoppers that should secure the cargo. The company was authorized by the port of Hamburg to conduct hot works, so the burning off commenced. 
After some steel residues were burnt off, the vessel had to shift astern by a couple of hundred meters to free the berth for another vessel. The hot work conducting group decided to use this time to make a break at their vehicle on the pier. 
On arrival the new position, the company’s superintendent noticed smoke developing at the cargo hold ventilation exhausts. After informing the captain, he detected the smoke source in a hold. The ventilation flaps of the cargo hold were closed by the crew, so that CO2 could be released into the hold.
While the crew was delegated to different measures including the cooling of the hatch covers in the affected area, the fire brigade arrived on the pier and from sea side.
After two hours, a hatch was opened and the smouldering area could be identified. Fire fighters entered with hand held fire extinguishers to keep the reigniting under control. After cooling with foam from the top, it was possible to use a shore crane for emergency discharge. The cellulose packages were finally drenched on the pier and extinguished.

On the morning of 31 March 2012, a collision took place inside Sungei Jurong between the piloted Crest Titan 2 (LoA 49.6m) and pleasure craft Basilisk (SZ11641F_LoA 13.5m). The collision occurred in good visibility and the weather was fine.
The collision caused 4 passengers from Basilisk to fall overboard. Three of them were rescued within minutes while the body of the fourth was found the next day. Of the three rescued, one was pronounced dead on the scene. The other two were warded and subsequently discharged without any serious injuries.
Investigations revealed that the main cause was the lack of proper look-outs on both vessels. Crest Titan 2 was unaware of Basilisk or of the collision until advised by MPA. This could be due to the relatively smaller Basilisk approaching Crest Titan 2 from the blind sector inherent in the bridge design (Crest Titan 2). The Class C (entry-level) harbour pilot was concentrating on an inbound vessel in the East Jurong Channel and too was unaware of Basilisk.
Basilisk was unaware of Crest Titan 2 until moments before the collision. Despite hard helm and increase speed, it was to no avail as Crest Titan 2 collided into the port quarter of Basilisk. Both vessels were on converging courses and making more than 5 knots (exceeded the speed limit_river)  when the collision occurred.
It appeared that the steersman of Basilisk displayed the human error of lack of situational awareness while the Master of Crest Titan 2 displayed both lack of situational awareness and incorrect identification .

were no injuries, but very serious material damage to the bridge and minor damage to the ship.
It had been agreed between the ship and the bridge keeper that passage could take place at 2226
hours. The time matched the train traffic across the bridge and the ship's speed was adjusted accordingly.
The bridge keeper’s disposition of the timing up to the passage at 2226 hours was based on specific
attention to a train crossing the Railway Bridge and his experience and routine with the typical
timing in connection with bascule openings and ship passages. This led to a very narrow time margin
from the train crossing the Railway Bridge to the immediately subsequent opening process for
the vessel's intended passage through the bridge.
The ship sailed faster than predicted by the bridge keeper and arrived at the Railway Bridge earlier
than the bascule could be opened. When the bridge keeper noticed this and informed the ship that
it had to stop, the ship was too close to the bridge to do so.
The light signals on the Railway Bridge had no effect on the master's dispositions and manoeuvres
as they were not turned on while there was still time and room to manoeuvre. Therefore the master
decided to adhere to the verbal agreement on the time of passage.","General Cargo Ship","Ship remains fit to proceed","1297","Germanischer Lloyd (GL)","1529","","4","0","0","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","2013-09-27",""

On that morning the A/B (Able Bodied Seaman) Yusuf Akyazi was working picking up “Stage” with the Bosun (a platform made of a wooden plank with transverse bearers and fitted with an above waste-height flat bar cage provided to keep people working safely inside).

For the two previous days, the ship’s crew had used two of these Stages for the purpose of safely chipping & painting around the aft Engine Casing.

A/B Yusuf Akyazi had been working the last two days inside a Stage.

On the 28th March, the third day of work, the Bosun decided to keep A/B Akyazi on the Funnel Deck to chip & paint the handrails around the deck area.

The Stage remained from previous day about 2 meters below funnel deck level.

The Bosun, having returned from forecastle area, after handing-out jobs to other crew members, following the Tool Box Meeting at about 09:00 hours, started with A/B Akyazi to pull the Stage up to Engine Casing Top. The intention was to shift the Stage towards the Forward Bulkhead of Engine Casing for another A/B to work inside it, while A/B Akyaki would continue to chip & paint the deck area handrail.

As A/B Akyazi was working on top of Engine Casing, he was wearing a Safety Belt but without it being attached to the ship’s structure.

The Bosun and A/B pulled about two times (lifting the Stage about a half metre). 

While pulling, the Bosun, being left handed, was positioned with his back toward A/B Akyazi, as he was using his left arm to pull and using his leg against the handrail, when he heard a noise similar to that the Stage would make when hitting the casing / bulkhead. He also felt a change in the rope tension. When he turned round and looked down he saw A/B Akyazi falling down on top of the entrance to the Steering Gear Casing, hitting his shoulder and then falling further down to the Poop Deck. 


Nobody saw how his fall started, or how he was pulling on rope to raise the Stage, but it was assumed that he was bending over the handrails most probably while standing on the first tier round bar, above the deck.

There was no scream or shout when he was falling.

A minute after the fall he regained consciousness and was conscious until the boat arrived to take him to hospital (about 2.5 hours). He was talking with crew members asking questions about how he fell. He walked to gangway with assistance of crew (about 25 metres) then the stretcher was used to lower him to the boat.

He died later in the hospital ashore on 3rd April 2012.

When the vessels had passed Dover the lookouts on both had been stood down, although the visibility in the area remained poor. The vessels were making differing speeds; the faster, a 12,000tonne refrigerated cargo vessel was making 19 knots while the other, a 3,000 tonne LPG tanker, was making 8 knots. The master of the cargo vessel was the officer of the watch (OOW); on the bridge with him were his son and another relative, who were both on board as passengers. The master detected the tanker radar at a range of 6 miles, right ahead, but did not use the automatic plotting aid to acquire the target's information. 
As the range between the vessels continued to decrease, the master of the tanker who had gone to the poop deck happened to look up and saw the cargo vessel very close astern. With collision imminent, he ran to the bridge and put the helm hard to port. The cargo vessel's master had no time to take action as the tanker had been in the blind sector created by the deck cranes of the cargo vessel and the vessels collided. Following the collision both vessels contacted the coastguard and were directed to port for survey. Both vessels sustained shell damage above the waterline, which required repair work before they could resume commercial service. Fortunately, there were no injuries.

The rescue boat SALVAMAR SUHAIL was sent to the scene of the accident to assist the shipwrecked persons, which was not necessary because the fishing boat RUMBO AL MAR reported that it did not require assistance, for this reason SALVAMAR SAHUAIL and HELIMER 206 remained at the site of the incident to see the wreckage remains and possible pollution in the area. A gas-oil stain of approximately 70 x 30 meters was observed and remains of the damaged fishing vessel such as cork boxes and remains of the fishing gear. On the other hand, the fishing boat RUMBO AL MAR went with the three crewmembers of the damaged fishing boat to Puerto de Santa Mara where it arrived at approximately 14:00 hours. CONCLUSIONS The Commission concluded that the events leading to the loss of B/P ANDALUCIA SEGUNDO did not take place in the manner in which they were reported by their crewmembers. Nor has the Commission been able to examine the vessel, as it has not been found in the place the Crew stated the sinking happened neither in its surroundings. Therefore, and in the absence of any other elements of judgment, the Commission has not been able to establish a reasonable hyposthesis for the loss due to technical reasons of B/P ANDALUCA SEGUNDO.

At one point in time, the vessel rolled heavily, first to starboard side then port side. 

This resulted in two crew members, the second mate, and the chief engineer, both on the bridge at the time, being flung from their stationary positions.  The second mate sustained severe rib injuries. 

The chief engineer suffered a severe head injury and was bleeding profusely.  First Aid was administered and communications established with shore emergency response parties. 

Having assessed the injuries of the two crew members, and after consulting with a medical doctor from the Emergency 

Medical Centre ashore, it was decided to initiate a MEDEVAC.  However, before arriving ashore, the chief engineer succumbed to his injuries.  The second mate was hospitalised and received the necessary medical treatment. 

Three recommendations have been made to the managers of the vessel intended to address risks and other important facets of the safety management system.","General Cargo Ship","Serious injuries","3117","Bureau Veritas (BV)","4506","","9","0","0","1","","","1","","","2014-07-15",""

The given area of interest was strongly under the influence of the mentioned developing depression. The sustained wind speeds reached up to strong gale force (9Bf) widely spread with gusts temporary increasing to storm (10Bf) and wave height over the area did increase accordingly to a significant
height of 5 to 6 meters, resulting in maximum waves between 9 and 10 meters.
On being advised that the port was closed the master attempted to abort the port approach but found great difficulty in turning through the weather and sea conditions without the main engine over speed tripping due to the propeller being heaved out of the water as a result of the extreme motion of the vessel with the inability to attempt to change the angle of drift to clear the vessel from the headland resulting in vessel not brought under control.
A series of unsuccessful attempts were made to turn the vessel away from the coast but eventually she grounded with both anchors run out.
There were no person injuries. All crew members, 19 persons including the Italian Master (10 Italians, 5 Filipinos, 4 Rumanians) , were rescued by the Italian Coast Guard Helicopters , following instruction from the unified command structure at S.ta Panagia harbour as there was no other way to safely get them to the shore.

The vessel grounded due to a navigational error caused by the masters, who hold a PEC (Pilot Exemption Certificate). The grounding occurred while the chief mate was standing the navigational watch with the master giving advice on course and speed to be kept.
The vessel was deployed on a tight schedule and more than one call per day on near by terminals with only little sea passages to cover were an almost regular part of the service.
The grounding occurred during darkness at moderate weather conditions with good visibility but strong winds. There were no fatalities or major injuries but the vessel experienced severe water ingress. Shortly after the accident the master sent a mayday and the Coast Guard and selvage tugs got involved. Minor oil spills observed from a surveillance air craft were immediately battled with oil spill response resources put on scene by the Coast Guard. Major environment degradation could be defended. Celina remained stuck on the rocks until 18 March to be than lifted by higher tides after having partly been relieved from containers and bunkers.
The flag State CCI (Chief Casualty Investigator) has decided to undergo a full independent investigation into this serious marine casualty, after the consultation with Norway, being the coastal State, resulted in no agreement for a joint investigation. Relevant notifications (Part II, chap. 5 and 20 of the Casualty Investigation Code) have been sending out. 
Without a prematurely statement before a conclusion on the underlying causes of the casualty has been reached it appears to be obvious that the bridge team may have been affected by fatigue.

The vessel had commenced to load loose pipes in a centre tweendeck after cargo discharge had been completed the day before. At this stage the vessel was in an almost light condition.
The stevedores had started the pipe stowage on port side ship’s tweendeck wall toward the vessel’s centre line to than proceed with a second, third and fourth on-top layer stowage without having the first layer stowage completed beyond the centre line up to the starboard side hold wall. The stevedores had chosen this mode of stowing because the vessel at that time had a slight port list, an almost normal condition caused by the two vessel’s deck cranes mounted on deck port side foreword and aft. This slight portside list kept the loose pipes in their origin stow position with no need to be secured and prevented from rolling with wedges placed along their  length. 
The pipe loading was in progress uneventful till the vessel’s deck crew was asked by the stevedores to put a 20 foot container with lashing material ashore which was yet placed on deck in front of the vessel accommodation. 
The container was lifted with the vessel’s aft crane and shifted ashore. The process of swinging the container around and to drop it on the wharf caused the vessel to cease from listing to port and heeled to starboard. As a consequence thereof the tweendeck top layer of still unsecured pipes got rolling and buried two stevedore workers. 
The cargo operation was stopped immediately and the two casualties removed from the pipe debris. They were hospitalized but there they both could only be declared death.

underway in the Aegean Sea with an eight member vessel operation crew.
Weather conditions were relatively good (following sea and wind) and both engines
were running; the average speed made good was close to 14 knots (cf. 7.6).
An abnormal cooling freshwater temperature rise and a leak on the starboard engine
exhaust, obligated the master who was on watch to stop this engine. Soon after, as the port engine was overheating, it shut down automatically while the chief engineer, on watch, was asking the master to reduce the motor speed. The master informed the designated person ashore.
The vessel was then drifting, broadside on to the waves, and listing to port. The
strainers of both engine sea water cooling circuits had been checked but found clean. The port engine had been restarted and the temperatures were back to normal; the master decided to head to Skyros Island, 25 miles away, but the helm was out of order and a rudder angle of 30° to starboard was displayed.
Therefore, investigations were then undertook by the first officer and the engineers towards the three aft compartments (beach club 1, beach club 2 and steering room); all of them
were found partially flooded, with different heights of water. Pumping was started.
A PAN PAN alert had been transmitted and a request for assistance by a tug had been sent to the Greek authorities. Due to the tacking, the list shifted to starboard then suddenly
increased. The pumping means became unserviceable. Soon after, the lower deck and the main deck were flooded.
A MAYDAY with a ship evacuation call had been transmitted. A salvage tug had been made ready and the intervention of a Greek Coast Guard helicopter had been rapidly confirmed.
At 8.50 am, the winching operations were completed and the crew was safe and sound. At the end of the morning,  YOGI sank to the bottom at a depth of 500 meters.

Incorrect information was given as to CAMISEA's exact location; instead of approaching the Palomino Islets, CAMISEA was actually in the vicinity of the San Lorenzo Island.  The Master immediately ordered for the manoeuvring speed to be reduced.  The Watch Officer was ordered by the Vessel Traffic Control Centre of the Maritime Coast Guard Captaincy of Callao to go to the anchorage No. 8 while waiting for the pilot to arrive and then to proceed to moor the ship on buoys at the 'La Pampilla' port facility.  Existing mist at the time resulted in low visibility and a vision scope of no more than 50 m.  The Master was again informed as to the ship's exact position; given the ship’s length and its superstructure.  The Master immediately made his way to the bridge, however on his way, the ‘CAMISEA’ collided with the Chinese F/V Yan Yu 664; resulting in a hole of about 1 m in diameter and a tear of part of the gunwale at the level of the port bow of the fishing ship.  The Master ordered for the engines to be stopped and all crew were alerted as to the collision. Assistance was offered, however not afforded as ‘YAN YU’ continued to navigate without any risks.

On 05 February 2012, at 0645(UTC + 2), the fire alarm panel on the bridge indicated the activation of a heat detector in the cook’s cabin. Several minutes later, the chief mate activated the vessel’s general alarm but the fire spread rapidly from the cook’s cabin, situated on the starboard side of the first deck. In about 30 minutes, all forward cabins on the starboard side were engulfed in flames. The fire continued to spread across the alleyway to the port side cabins and also on the bridge deck.


For three and a half hours, the crew members tried without success to contain and extinguish the fire with water hoses from the alleyway and the external superstructure. The cold weather conditions in addition to the prevailing strong winds, the intensity of the fire, and the dense smoke hindered the fire- fighting operation. Eventually, the master had to order the evacuation of the vessel.

By the next day, the fire had burnt itself out.

The safety investigation concluded that the fire spread as a result of several factors including the weather conditions, and the duration of the fire inside the cabins.","General Cargo Ship","Ship rendered unfit to proceed","4966","Russian Maritime Register of Shipping (RMRS)","5885","","14","0","0","","","","","","","2016-01-06",""

Loading operations commenced at 0950 (LT), after the safety checks were formally completed. There were eight cargo parcels, which had to be loaded; four parcels of Styrene monomer and four parcels of Polyol. 

About one hour into the cargo operations, the port emergency centre received a report of cargo pollution within the Terminal.  Cargo operations were eventually suspended at 1105 (LT). 

Emergency level was raised by the Terminal’s emergency centre and several resources to mitigate the pollution.  The Spanish authorities estimated that cargo spill was in the order of 100 metric tonnes. 

Although MSIU has not established with utmost certainty the circumstances into the cargo spill, one recommendation was made both to the vessel’s managers and Terminals intended to improve the cargo operations procedures.","Chemical Tanker","Ship remains fit to proceed","2603","American Bureau of Shipping (ABS)","3456","Liquid cargo - Chemicals","14","0","0","","","","","","","2014-11-06",""

The MRCCs La Palmas, Lisboa, Ponta Delgada, the US and Netherland's Coast Guard responded on the distress alert immediately and Ponta Delgada was assigned to act as Search and Rescue Unit (SRU) for this SAR operation. Further engaged in the mission was the Portuguese aircraft ""Rescue 22"" and the Navy vessel ""N.R.P.J. Candido"".
While CSAV TOTORAL returned and searched back on her recorded ECDIS track the aircraft and the naval vessel searched the dimensions ot the defined area. 
CSAV TOTORAL returned all the way towards the position where the 2nd engineer had been allegedly seen the last time and reported the result of the search to the SRU.

The passenger ship DEUTSCHLAND was on a cruise through the group of islands off southern Chile and reached the Italia Glacier in the northern arm of the Beagle Channel on Sunday 15 January 2012 at about 2300. The master, an officer on watch, a helmsman and a pilot were on the bridge. A few minutes before reaching the glacier, the ship's command asked the pilot if it would be acceptable to sail closer to the glacier than planned so as to provide passengers with the best possible view of this area. The pilot responded with a decision to reduce the speed and sail much closer to the glacier.
The DEUTSCHLAND grounded on her starboard side as she was turning back towards the middle of the fjord two cables away from the coastline. The engine was stopped immediately and instructions to establish the damage to the ship were given.
It was possible to move the ship back in the direction of the middle of the fjord by means of various engine and helm manoeuvres a short time later and continue the voyage to the next port.

	On 9 January 2012 at about 1830h, the Indian Chief Mate (Indian CoC) and 2 crew entered the no. 4(S) cargo tank to remove some water near the sump area. At that time, Sigloo Crystal (LoA 131m) was on ballast and drifting off Shanghai, awaiting instructions to enter port.
	After about 10 minutes, the 2 crew reported having headaches and the Chief Mate told them to leave the tank for some fresh air. At about 1845h, the duo re-entered the tank. But after afew minutes, again both reported feeling unwell and the Chief Mate told them to go for a breather. The 2 crew left the tank and met the deck Cadet at the main deck.
According to the agreed tank-entry procedures, the Cadet (standing near the tank opening on the main deck), would every 5 minutes initiate a walkie-talkie call to the Chief Mate to confirm that all is well. At a time recorded as about 1858h, the Chief Mate stopped responding to these calls and the emergency alarm was raised.
Rescue efforts commenced immediately with 2 rescue teams (wearing breathing apparatus) taking turns to enter the tank. At about 1929h, the unconscious Chief Mate was lifted out of the tank on a stretcher. The crew administered CPR but there was no response from the Chief Mate. Some 4 hours later, shore medical officers inspected the Chief Mate but could not detect any life-signs i.e. already dead.
The autopsy report indicated the cause of death as ‘coronary atherosclerosis  heart disease, complicated by Butadiene and CO (carbon monoxide) inhalation. The manner of death is nature (sic)’ i.e. no foul play was suspected.
Investigations revealed that in September 2011, the deceased was certified fit for sea during a pre-employment medical examination. Inspection of the deceased cabin did not revealed anything suspicious or indicate any signs of taking of drugs/medication. It appeared that the deceased was unaware of his heart condition and thus his lowered toxicity threshold and the adverse consequences thereof.
There is also no evidence to suggest any compromise of the procedures with regards to the entry into the no. 4(S) tank and all the gas detection equipment used were found to be working satisfactorily.
Following the incident, the owners enhanced the pre-employment medical examination by including new tests to detect any latent medical condition such as atherosclerosis.

Brazilian coast when a fire broke out in the ship’s hospital.
The cause of the fire was most likely self ignition by a chemical reaction between chlorinecontaining
granules and other chemical substances in a plastic box with medicine and chemical
residues located in the ship's hospital.
Initially, an attempt was made to fight the fire with a portable fire extinguisher with dry powder.
However, this was in vain because the fire was already too extensive. Thereafter the fire was
fought and extinguished effectively with water by fire fighting teams using air breathing apparatuses.
A supernumerary master acted as the first man on the fire hose and thus he was the leader
in each fire fighting team with an AB as the 2nd man.
2½ hours after the fire broke out the ship headed for Rio de Janeiro and arrived the next day.
The ship’s hospital burned out and the adjoining corridor, TV/recreation room, mess room and duty
mess was also damaged as a result of the fire. The fire and smoke damages to the ship’s interior
were severe.
During the fire, it appeared that the two accesses to the air compressor for refilling air bottles to the
firemen’s outfits that was situated in the bosun’s store in the forecastle was hindered through the
deck hatch by a locked padlock, and through the accommodation by the dense smoke in the accommodation,
and refilling of air bottles was not possible. Even though this did not create any
problem, it was considered a lesson to be learned.
This report does not contain any recommendation. After this incident, the shipping company has
initiated a number of preventive measures.","Anchor Handling Tug Supply","Ship remains fit to proceed","2887","DNV AS (DNV)","2546","","14","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","2012-11-05",""

Le 7 janvier 2012, le navire se trouve dans le nord-ouest de l’Ecosse, dans le secteur des îles Hébrides. Il fait mauvais temps. 
En fin de matinée, la fune tribord casse. L’autre fune est virée et le panneau bâbord saisi. Puis, une maille sur le bras bâbord cède. L’ensemble du train de pêche, excepté le panneau déjà embarqué, est perdu.
Un peu avant minuit ; le vent ayant molli, l’opération de  « grappinage » débute afin de récupérer le chalut. Après quelques heures de recherches et plusieurs tentatives infructueuses, le train de pêche perdu est remonté  à la surface, le cul du chalut ayant été croché par le grappin.
Une équipe, composée du bosco, du treuilliste et de deux matelots, est sur le pont pour ma manœuvre de récupération. Le câble est viré au maximum et le grappin se trouve en hauteur, au niveau de la chape de la poulie tribord.
Le bosco se penche par-dessus la lisse et cherche, derrière les fils du vahiné l’endroit le plus approprié pour fixer le croc de la caliorne afin de remonter l’ensemble à bord. A ce moment, vers 03 :10 hrs, le treuil dévire automatiquement d’ environ 2 mètres, du fait du tangage et du poids du train de pêche. Le bosco est entrainé à l’ eau et mortellement blessé par le grappin.
Des bouées couronnes lui sont lancées. Un canot est mis à la mer pour le secourir. Le corps sans vie est récupéré par l’équipe du canot, puis embarqué à bord.
L’hélicoptère  des secours tentera d’hélitreuiller une équipe médicale, sans succès du fait de la force du vent et de l’état de la mer. 
Le navire rentre ensuite à Stornoway.

During her transit in the Strait, Seeb was on manoeuvring speed and hand steering.  The vessel was constrained by her draft and displayed the required signals in the deep water route. 

Kota Tenaga, which was bound for India, had earlier dropped the Singapore PSAM pilot (Jong Fairway).  Her master was taking actions to avoid the west-bound LPG carrier Yosu Gas on her port side.  However, inadvertently, Kota Tenaga manoeuvred in such a way that she entered the Deep Water Route into the path of the east-bound Seeb.  Subsequently, both vessels collided. 

Seeb suffered s ome damages to her forecastle deck fittings, dents and paint scratches on her starboard side shell all the way from stem to the forecastle deck.  Her structural integrity, however, was not breached.  Kota Tenaga sustained damages to fuel tank no. 3 port, resulting in a spill of about 54 metric tonnes of fuel oil, and the loss of two loaded containers of which one was later recovered.  The vessel was rendered unfit to proceed with her voyage.  There were no reports of any injuries from both ships. 

The relevant authorities were informed about this accident.  In line with instructions from VTIS, Singapore, Seeb then proceeded towards Eastern Boarding Ground for anchoring.  Containment and clean-up efforts continued until 07 January 2012.  During this period, there was no disruption to traffic movements in the TSS. 

The safety investigation, which was carried out with the assistance and cooperation of the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore, concluded that Kota Tenaga had entered the Deep Water Route and was unaware of Seeb until moments before the collision. 

As a result of the safety investigation, two recommendations have been made to Kota Tenaga’s and Seeb’s managers, which are intended to improve the standard of look-out and bridge watch keeping.","Oil Tanker","Ship remains fit to proceed","164359","Lloyd's Register (LR)","319439","Liquid cargo - Oil","24","0","0","","","","","","","2014-03-06",""

On the afternoon of 2 January 2012, Theresa Dua (LoA 138m), on ballast, was in open waters and experiencing moderate rolling. The Myanmese deck cadet and one seaman were using a tripod winch to hoist a portable cargo pump from a cargo tank. The seaman was on deck operating the winch while the cadet was inside the tank, climbing a fixed step-ladder while manually (hand) guiding the pump.
When the pump was about 2 metres from the deck opening, the vessel experienced a heavy roll. The pump hurled violently against the cadet and caused him to fall to the tank top – a height of about 9m. The Myanmese Master (Myanmar CoC) and Chief Officer arrived at the scene soon after to render first aid. The cadet was coherent and although complaining about pain of his right arm and stomach, declined being strapped to a stretcher. He managed to climb the stairs by himself with assistance of the crew.
The Master requested for medi-evacuation but the nearest MRCC (Philippines Coast Guard) could not provide such services. The Master then diverted to the nearest port of Manila, some 150 nm away. Meanwhile the crew was in regular contact with the Manila medical team to monitor the cadet’s condition. However, on 3 January at about 0030hrs, the cadet succumbs to his injuries and died onboard. The port-mortem report indicates the cause of death as internal injuries and no foul play was suspected.
Investigations revealed that no instructions were given to the crew to hoist the pump but only to clean the cargo tank. Apparently, the seaman and cadet, on their own accord, carried out the task without any risk assessment, authorisation or supervision.

Sea conditions were north-westerly winds of less than 10 knots and smooth seas.  Conditions worsened as the ship reached Cape Campbell on the eastern side of Willaumez Peninsula, where rough seas, rain and strong north-westerly winds prevailed; causing spray from the sea to come over the starboard side of the ship.  Passengers moved to the port side of the ship or inside to keep dry.  The movement of passengers combined with the wind exerting a force on the starboard side of the ship, resulted in the ship developing a port list.  At 0220 on 2 February, the Chief Mate altered the course to make for the Nessup Channel.  At 0330, the Master was called to navigate the ship through the Siassi Islands and into the Vitiaz Strait.  On leaving the lee of Umboi Island, steering became uneasy, as winds had increased to between 20 and 30 knots and the seas to 3.0 m.  The Master took the ship out of auto-pilot, into hand steering and took the helm.  The prevailing winds and the imbalance of the ship caused her to maintain port list, exposing more of its starboard side to the weather and sea.  At 0615, a large wave hit the ship on its starboard quarter.  The stern was pushed to port and the ship heeled heavily over to port, causing her to come beam onto the north-westerly.  The Master lost steerage of the ship and was not able to bring its head back around the port.  A second wave hit the starboard side of the ship as it was returning to the upright, causing it again to heel over to port.  The heel angle was far greater and resulted in the ship’s port side becoming submerged causing water to flood into the accommodation.  The ship was heeled over for a shot time when a third wave hit the exposed hull and the ship capsized.   Due to the speed at which the ship capsized, the Master did not have time to give a mayday signal.  The Master and 3 employees were in the wheelhouse as it filled up with water.  Three of the four men were able to swim to safety before the ship sank.  Liferafts, lifejackets and buoyant flotation devices floated to the surface.  Survivors managed to swim to liferafts, while others were assisted on board.  The first rescue ship arrived at 0940; 3 hours after the ship sank.  246 passengers were rescued, 4 were pronounced dead and as many as 161 persons were considered to be missing and presumed dead.
As the ship sank, fuel and bilge oil from the engine room began to float on the surface of the sea.

When attempts to fix the issues failed, the Master of the vessel contacted Al Hamriyah Port officials for help. The Master told the port's sea monitors at the control unit that the vessel's engines were struggling. Later, he told them he had lost control of the vessel's steering, and by then the vessel, loaded with diesel fuel cargo, had started sinking. The control unit notified the coast guard, which rushed to the vessel and rescued the five Indian crewmen, officials said. The vessel soon sunk completely, leaving small traces of oil leakage in the water.
