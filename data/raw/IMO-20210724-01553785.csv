At around 19.00  hours LT, as the last part of the catch was being tackled in, the ship suddenly heeled to starboard.
The skipper, who was handling the tackle winch from the deck, immediately eased out the winch. The ship did not get back on an even keel, but found balance for a brief moment with the rail under water.
The skipper engaged the propeller and swung the ship around in an attempt to get the sea from aft in order to minimize the list. This was done without any positive result and the ship capsized. 
The skipper managed to get out of the wheelhouse.
The two others crewmembers, who were on the deck amidships, got caught under the shelter deck but they managed to get out.
Together they managed to disengage the life raft from its stowing position on the top of the wheelhouse and to release it. The ship’s second man drifted away while they were working with the life-raft and the others lost contact with him in the dark. 
The water was very cold, and none of the crewmembers had had the time to put on life jackets or immersion suits.
The skipper and the 3rd man entered the life raft and managed to release it from the ship.
The Danish Admiral Fleet was alarmed by the ship’s EPIRB and a search and rescue operation was initiated.

The Danish Admiral Fleet tried to establish contact with the ship via Lyngby Ra-dio. As the ship did not reply to the calls, ships and a rescue helicopter began searching for the ship.

The skipper and the ship’s 3rd man were rescued from the raft by the helicopter approximately 1½ hours after the ship’s EPIRB had been activated.

Shortly after, the ship’s 2nd man was found dead.

Vessel's draft was 47 ft. When the vessel approached one (1) mile from College Point, where the river makes a U-turn, a tug boat pushing seven barges (approximate length 350 metres) was observed visually and on radar screen. The direction of the tow was at approximately 45° angle to the riverside, thus resulting to the restriction of navigable waters (depth over 50 ft). The pilot and the Master attempted several times to speak with the tug master calling him in the appropriate frequency in VHF and using the vessel's whistle, with negative results. In order to avoid collision with the tow and as there was not any better alnernative, due to restricted waters (1,5 cable), limited time and constraint in vessel's manoeuvrability the pilot advised the Master to  start making a sharper strbd turn which resulted in the vessel's pulling out of the bend earlier than the normal.

At 03.00 hours LT the vessel was in position at the berth and berthing manoeuvres were almost completed, with two head ropes and two springs forward and two stern ropes and two springs aft.  The attending port pilot received instructions from the terminal to shift the vessel approximately 8 metres astern due to operational reasons.

To carry out this movement at the aft station, one stern line and one spring were paid out from the vessel’s side and the corresponding two others were kept on the winch drums.The second mate, who was in charge of organising and monitoring the mooring operations at the aft station, was at the time standing on the port side open roller chock.  As soon as the spring was released from the vessel’s side, he tried to stop it with his left foot, while his right foot remained on the fore roller.

The spring was by then paying out with a high velocity due to the vessel’s movement.  When the second mate put his foot on the rope to stop it, his foot was swept away by the rope’s speedy movement in the direction of the second spring, which was running through the mooring fore roller entrapping his foot between the two springs.

The second mate tried desperately to pull his foot clear by using his right leg.  In doing so, both legs were entrapped between the spring ropes and the rollers.  The mooring roller chocks have a steel pipe welded around the chock assembly to prevent the ropes from slipping out of the chocks.  The second mate’s feet were caught between the rope/chock/pipe combination and he suffered serious injuries to one of his feet, resulting in the instant loss of one foot and serious injuries to the other.

The master who was on the bridge wing, heard the shouting from the poop deck and tried to stop the vessel from going astern by ordering slow ahead on the main engine, but by this time the second mate was already seriously injured. The able seaman, who was operating the winch, released the tension on the spring by paying out the winch drum and the second officer was released from the ropes.  The crewmembers started to administer first aid.  An ambulance was called and at 04.00 hours LT the second mate was taken to the Rosario City hospital.

On 19 January 2006 the second mate succumbed to his injuries at the hospital and died.","BULK CARRIER","Loss of life,Serious injuries","22992","Lloyd's Register (LR)","38584","Dry bulk","22","0","0","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","",""

The general cargo Star Herdla is in the South-West Lane of the Dover Strait Tss, course made good 108°, speed 11.3 knots heading to Boulogne-sur-Mer approaches.
The visibility varies from five to one cable.
The Cape Bradley after ""South-East Ridens"" buoy alters course made good to 020°, in line with the lane. The OOW, supported by an AB as helmsperson, sees on the radar display several ship contacts, both on port and starboard sides, transiting in the same direction and one contact on the port side heading 108°, thus ""crossing"". 
At the same time, Star Herdla is close to begin to cross the North-East Lane. The master, supported by the Chief Officer, the OOW and an AB as helmsperson, observes on the radar display five contacts heading in the North-East Lane on his right hand side at various ranges. He alters course to the right in order to pass on the aft of the two first. At 07:15 hours, the three other ships are all about on the same parallel at the range of about 1.6 mile. Star Herdla can cross on the bow of Cape Bradley, which is among these ships with a CPQ of 0.21 mile. Anyway the Master keeps on turning right to course 160°, likely to pass on Cape Bradley port side and then to cross on her aft. At an estimated range of 0.6 or 0.7 mile from her the master suddenly decides a hard to port manoeuvre at a speed of 10 knots. 
Both ships, Cape Bradley maintaining her speed and shyly altering her course to port side, and Star Herdla during a hard to port manoeuvre collided in the French territorial waters between 07:19 and 07:20 hours at position 50°45.447 N and 001°22.8543 E, that is in the bearing 296° from Cape Alprech at 7.9 miles.
The collision angle between the two ships is about 90°. On Star Herdla the impact is on the aft of the starboard side at the gangway level. On Cape Bradley the impact is at the bow
For Star Herdla the immediate consequence is a blackout leading to the loss of the main engine. Star Herdla is adrift in the North-East Lane without any manoeuvring capacity. Cape Bradley, after the collision keeps her course in the North-East Lane with a slower speed.

The pilot planned to enter the port to the west of the track marked by the main leading lights, to keep the ship out of an opposing tidal flow for as long as possible. When the ship was almost abeam of Point Lonsdale Lighthouse, the pilot thought he could see the high and low main leading lights just open to the west. This indicated to him that the ship was on the edge of the Great Ship Channel. However, the ship was further to the west than the pilot thought. 

The ship continued the transit and anchored at 1154. No one on board the ship observed anything that might have suggested that the ship had grounded during the pilotage. 

At about 1245, the chief mate found the level in the lower fore peak water ballast tank rising. He told the master, and they decided to pump out the tank and inspect it. The inspection revealed that the tank’s shell plating had been holed. 

The ship berthed in Geelong on 5 January and temporary repairs were carried out before it sailed for Singapore on 19 January, where it was dry-docked for permanent repairs.

At 00.40 hours on 22 December 2005, a pilot and two channel helmsman boarded the vessel in preparation for the vessel’s departure.  In the meantime, the crew members were working in the no.5 cargo hold sweeping the last residues of iron ore and filling plastic buckets.  The buckets were being lifted from the cargo hold by means of a portable air operated winch, which was situated on deck on the vessel’s centreline.  The bosun was operating the winch while another seaman was carrying the buckets on the main deck to the port side of the vessel.  When the work was almost finished, the bosuns left the area to go and close the No. 3 cargo hold hatches and left the operation of the winch to the seaman.

The two seamen, who were working in the cargo hold, filled the last bucket and one of them climbed out of the hold and went near the winch on deck and took over the winching operation, while the crew member on deck carried the buckets to the port side.The other seaman, who was in the hold, hooked the last bucket onto the winch hook and as the winch operator started to haul up the bucket, he walked away with the intention to climb out of the hold.

Some time later he heard an unusual noise and as he turned round he saw a person falling down into the hold.  The winch mechanism was at an unusual angle and the bucket, which was being winched, stopped half way up the hold.The alarm was raised and assistance was requested from the port authorities.

At 01.00 hours LT an ambulance and a doctor arrived on board and the seaman who had fallen into the hold was declared dead.","BULK CARRIER","Loss of life","41726","Lloyd's Register (LR)","77078","Dry bulk","16","1","0","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","",""

The next day, in worsening weather conditions. the vessel's hull began to fracture, eventually causing substantial pollution to the coast of Faial, and to the islands of Pico and Sao Jorge.  The subsequent salvage operation was unsuccessful and she was declared a constructive total loss about 3 weeks later.
The vessel had been on a liner voyage from Montreal, Canada, to Valencia, Spain, when one of her main engine cylinder units was found to be overheating due to a cooling water leak.  The vessel continued on her planned track towards the central Azores at slow speed, while the Master and chief engineer decided on the best course of action.  They decided to head for a bay, which they assessed would be sheltered from a heavy SW'ly swell, in order to make the necessary repairs.  A cylinder head needed to be lifted and calm waters was essential.  The Master discussed the proposed action with the managers who then further discussed the proposal with the owners.  Agreement was reached and the Master was granted permission to proceed.
The bay contained a charted designated anchorage, but the largest scale British Admiralty chart of the island was of 1:175,000 scale.  Such a chart is not normally considered suitable for close inshore navigation.  There was only a single sounding of 36 metres in the bay.
The passage planning of the vessel's approach into the bay was rudimentary.  The bridge and anchoring team had different views on how to approach and anchoring operation was to be carried out.  In the event, the Master did not use the bridge team to its full capability, took on too much himself and became overloaded.
The vessel grounded at a speed of 6 knots while the Master was manoeuvring the vessel in the bay in search of calm water.  The engine telegraph had been inadvertently left on half ahead for several minutes.
Following the grounding, the intial salvage attempts by a local tug were unsuccessful.  The vessel was driven further aground the next day as the wind veered to blow directly into the bay.  The 1172 MT of heavy fuel and 118 MT of gas oil onboard began leaking into the sea.
A powerful salvage tug was on scene about 24 hours after the initial grounding but her attempts to re-float the vessel were also unsuccessful.
CP VALOUR was abandoned on 25 December 2005, after all the IMO classified hazardous cargo had been safely removed, along with 450 cubic metres of oil and water from her bunker tanks. Operations to remove the vessel from the beach began in the summer of 2006.

In the meantime the AB/cook tried to reset the release hook using the resetting handle.  He could not do so.  The Chief Officer somewhat irate removed the AB from the lifeboat and leaned into the lifeboat and fully unwound the hand wheel.  The release hook was then reset but because of the retained hydraulic pressure it was only partially reset.  When the vessel was berthing the release hook slipped from the release pawl and the lifeboat launched.

There was confusion whether the Chief Officer opened the by pass valve - the AB said that he was the only person in the boat, the cadet said that the Chief Officer remained outside the boat and did not open the by pass valve.  Other issues - poor signage & drill conduct.","Oil Tanker","Ship remains fit to proceed","3368","Lloyd's Register (LR)","4970","oil","12","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","",""

Between 16.00 hours and 16.54 hours loading operations were suspended as the vessel was requested to shift to the No. 2 berth, following which, the loading operations were resumed.

At this stage, the master of the vessel issued a Note of Protest to the stevedores, alleging that the weight of the cargo in the slings was exceeding the safe working load of the vessel’s cranes, of 25 mt.  At 02.00 hours on 24 November 2005, as the No. 4 crane lifted a sling to about 4 ½ metres from the berth, the crane runner came to an abrupt stop.  The crane driver apparently decided to lower the sling back onto the berth.  Suddenly the crane jib, main housing and the operator’s cabin fell down to the main deck of the vessel, with the boom’s end coming to rest on the berth.

The crane operator fell out of the crane’s cabin onto the vessel’s main deck between the No. 4 hatch and the No. 4 mast house.

In good time before entering the separation scheme the Officer of Watch (OOW) on the bridge of the Finnsailor observed, visually and on the radar, three ships on a parallel course heading east in the separation scheme. The OOW steered aft of the three ships and laid the Finnsailor on a parallel course between the northernmost ship and the one in the middle.  In his mind all three ships would continue in the direction of the separation lane and turn where the direction changes from approximately east-west to approximately northeast-southwest.  The southernmost of the four ships, the General Grot-Rowecki began to turn to port in order to continue along the new running of the separation lane.  The new course pointed in the front of the stem of the second southernmost ship, Dana 1, which was forced to turn also to port.  Since the attention of the OOW of Finnsailor was completely focused on the northernmost ship, Protector, he did not notice until late that the General Grot-Rowecki had turned to port with her course in front of the stem.  When Finnsailor realised that a hazardous close-quarters situation was a fact, the OOW tried to turn away by hard to port rudder.  The manoeuvre failed and the starboard quarter of the Finnsailor hit the port side of the General Grot-Rowecki in way of hatch no. 6.  The hulls of the two ships were seriously damaged and both had to proceed to a shipyard for repairs.","Bulk Dry (general, ore) Carrier","Ship rendered unfit to proceed","23409","Polski Rejestr Statkow (Polish Register of Shipping) (PRS)","38498","DRY BULK","21","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","2006-04-12",""

The vessel was in ballast. On 04 November 2006 at 11.55 hours LT, the vessel made fast with her port side alongside the starboard side of the MT UNITED SUNRISE, with five pneumatic fenders between the vessels. At 13.45 hours LT the loading hoses were connected and the loading of the cargo of VGO commenced.Wind was blowing at force 3, the sea was smooth, air temperature measured 4 degrees Celsius and the sea temperature was recorded 8 degrees Celsius. At 22.00 hours LT, the accommodation ladder of the MT UNITED SUNRISE was lowered down to the level of the deck of the MT AKADEMIK VERESHCHAGIN.  As the gangway platform was some metres away from the deck of the MT AKADEMIK VERESHCHAGIN’s deck, a gangway was rigged from the accommodation ladder’s platform to the main deck of the MT AKADEMIK VERESHCHAGIN to allow the cargo surveyors to board the vessel and carry out the cargo inspection surveys.  On 04 November 2005, at 22.00 hours LT when the accommodation ladder/gangway were rigged, the safety net was not put in place around the gangway arrangement.  The chief mate decided to leave the rigging up of the safety net until after sunrise.  At around sunrise two of the mooring ropes from forward broke.  The chief mate instructed the third mate who at the time was on deck to send the bosun and two seamen to replace the broken ropes forward.  He also instructed the third mate to collect a seawater sample from the starboard side for a density test and to bring the sample to the control room.  Afterwards he was to go to the poop and check the aft ropes and later on to supervise the rigging of the safety net around the accommodation ladder/gangway set up.  While the chief mate was in the control room at 08.25 hours LT on 05 November 2005, he saw the third mate going in the direction of the port side and he contacted the third mate via the VHF sets and instructed him not to go over to the accommodation ladder platform.  An able seaman who was taking the ullage of one of the port cargo tanks near the gangway contacted the chief mate via VHF and alarmed him that the tank was 95% full.  The chief mate moved away from the window to cancel the alarm on the port tank and when he looked out again he could not see the third mate and he noticed that the gangway was in a tilted position.  As he could not see third mate, the chief mate contacted the able seaman via VHF and asked him the whereabouts of the third mate.  At the same time, the chief mate saw the able seaman running to the port side with a life buoy and throwing it into the sea between the two vessels.

As the vessel arrived at the lock entrance, the dock master asked the master to hold off a bullnose to allow an outbound vessel to clear the lock, and the master then proceeded to land the vessel on the bullnose as is the usual procedure. However, the vessel landed heavily on the bullnose, unwittingly striking a bracket underwater which had become detached from the bullnose, causing two 30mm punctured holes in a starboard cargo tank.  Upon realising the vessel was leaking product, the master drove the vessel into the dock, and the dockmaster closed the gates to contain the pollution. A contractor was sourced to recover the estimated 250 litres of oil spilled, and the contents of the damaged cargo tank was transferred to other tanks. The damaged tank was then ventilated and the holes plugged with broom handles prior to a 600mm x 600mm insert plate being fitted to the hull. Most of the oil was recovered by the contractor, with the remainder dispersed by the elements. Following the accident, the port authority inspected the bullnose and noted that a fender had previously been removed for repair, exposing a bracket/lug underwater; these were subsequently burnt off down to the low water spring mark, with no further obstruction found. The authority decided that no unfendered single skin vessels were to use this bullnose, with a long term review to be conducted of fendering requirements.","TANKER","Pollution,Ship rendered unfit to proceed","380","[Flag Administration]","650","Oil","","","","","","","","","","",""

Later she was en route between Charleston and Houston USA when a scheduled fire and boat drill was carried out.  Prior to a lifeboat being lowered a debrief took place.   The starboard lifeboat was then swung out without incident.  The boat was then lowered, the brake would not hold and the boat continued to lower towards the water.  The master put the engine telegraph to stop.  Despite putting weight on the brake handle the brake was not able to stop the boat lowering into the water.  Despite the ship's forward motion, the boat was held by the painter and the two falls.  The electric winch control was connected and the boat began to be recovered.  When it was 2m from ""home"" the winch failed and the boat once again lowered to the water.  This time there was considerable slack in the falls and eventually the forward falls released, the painter pulled out from its securing point and the after falls disconnected.  The life
boat was lost as it was too dangerous to launch the other lifeboat in order to effect a recovery. Subsequent examination concluded that the starboard lifeboat winch brake had been incorrectly set after being inspected (it was not tested after the maintenance) and that, in all probability, the falls must have been set to relases before the boat was lowered.","Container Ship","Ship rendered unfit to proceed","49985","American Bureau of Shipping (ABS)","59964","","","","","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","",""

Shortly after the port pilot had left the ship, Doria grounded and was stuck south-west of the approach to the harbour in the area of the sandbank like shoal of “Baixo Amelia” 
No substantial damages were detected within the scope of the sounding taken immediately and of a first analysis of the damages, in particular no water ingress that would have made the continuation of the voyage impossible.
Then, in order to reduce the draught, the crew began to pump the water of the ballast tanks. Gradually some leakages in the tank system of Doria were detected which involved a minor water ingress and the corresponding spillages of oil and harmful substances.
At about 04:00 on 21 October 2005, Doria managed to get clear of the shoal under her own power and continued her voyage, as agreed with the ship operator and the classification society.
During the following days on sea, soundings were taken at regular intervals, and tanks were opened as far as possible. In this connection it became obvious that the extent of the damages to the underwater hull had to be greater than initially had been assumed.
 After several inquiries with various shipyards were unsuccessful, a shipyard in Durban (Republic of South Africa) could be booked for an inspection of the underwater hull and any repairs that might prove necessary.
There Doria was docked after a previous discharge of the container cargo on 01 November 2005. 
On this occasion, a not insignificant spill of heavy fuel oil and l locally restricted pollution of the environment occurred.

A fitter had been allocated the task of weld repairing the sewage system save-all base, while the duty oiler was assigned to standby in the workshop below and keep a fire watch.  The oiler left the workshop to answer the telephone, and then attended to a ballast pump fault that the second mate had alerted him to.  During this time the fitter continued to work, and it appears that molten metal from the welding process fell into the workshop, landing on coiled electrical cables, causing them to ignite.
The fire was detected by the fitter and the emergency alarm was raised.  The crew mustered and the Master contacted the port authority, who, in turn contacted the fire and emergency services.
The crew closed all the engine room doors and fire dampers while the Master and Chief engineer assessed the situation.  They decided to use the fixed fire extinguishing system, and at 1700 carbon dioxide was released into the engine room.

The second mate and an able seaman were on the bridge of the MV LEADER 1.  The vessel was navigating through a very busy area where numerous fishing boats were operating.  The second mate was monitoring one of these fishing boats, which was on his starboard bow on a reciprocal course and was sure that she would pass clear of his vessel on his starboard side. When the fishing boat was about 1 Nm away from the vessel, she stopped and then changed direction to her starboard and rapidly increased her speed.   The second mate tried to turn his vessel to starboard to avoid the ensuing collision.  In spite of these actions, the fishing boat made contact with the vessel’s bow and started to take in water immediately.The master, who came up on the bridge a short while after the collision, immediately informed the Search and Rescue Centre of the collision. The SAR Centre immediately commenced a search and rescue operation under the command of the South Korean Navy. About four ships, and later two helicopters, joined the search.  Some fishing vessels, which were in the vicinity, also took part in the SAR operation.The fishing boat was manned by 10 persons.  Eight crew members were rescued and one dead body was recovered.  Another crew member is still reported missing.

The platform’s construction was completed, and its delivery trials were carried, out in March 2005. 
During its voyage from Singapore to Bass Strait, Australia, the platform experienced two electrical fires in its thruster power system. On 12 September 2005, after it had entered Bass Strait, a fire started in the platform’s number four thruster transformer. On 18 September, a fire occurred in an electrical cabinet that was providing power to the number one thruster motor.
The investigation found that the transformer fire was probably the result of an internal short circuit that occurred when the insulation failed due to overheating. The cabinet fire was the result of an electrical arc that occurred because the bridging out of some electrical equipment was not adequately undertaken.
It was also considered that Safe Concordia was not fit to fulfil its charter obligations in view of the unresolved faults in the thrusters’ electrical power systems and the design of the platform did not allow for effective and safe fire fighting in the thruster rooms.
The report makes several recommendations to address these issues.

There were no injuries to the crew, but the vessel was severely damaged and about 84 tonnes of gas oil were lost into the environment. 
On the day of the accident, the ETV had been tasked, in one of its secondary roles, to carry out hydrographic survey sea trials in an area between Scalloway and the island of Foula. The trials finished at 2019, and the master, who was on watch, set course for the entrance to the South Channel for Scalloway harbour. After a short hiatus for a further trial, the master resumed a similar course, although as the final trial had displaced the ETV from its previous track, the vessel was now heading towards the small island of Oxna.  It was dark, but there was no lookout posted, so the master was alone on the bridge. Passing very close to Skelda Ness, the ETV maintained a steady course at 16 knots for 17 minutes until it grounded.
The master reported the grounding to Shetland Coastguard, and requested a rescue helicopter to evacuate all of his crew, who were mustering, in their survival suits and lifejackets, on the after working deck.  There was little effort to assess the situation before deciding to evacuate the vessel.  Unnoticed by the master, the ETV had floated off where it had grounded, and then drifted some distance before coming to rest in a cleft in one of the islands of the Cheynies.
By 2240, the mustered crew were evacuated by rescue helicopter, leaving the master alone on board.  At this stage, the master decided to clutch in the main engines and drive the ETV out of the cleft into the open sea. By 2253, Anglian Sovereign was underway, listing about 15° to starboard, trimmed down by the head, and was leaking diesel oil. Subsequently the master momentarily ran aground on another island, before successfully reaching and berthing in Scalloway.
The police boarded the ETV shortly after arrival, and breathalysed the master. Finding him to be 3.4 times over the proscribed limit for alcohol, he was arrested and taken to Lerwick police station.

1.2	Pulper systems process food waste from the ship’s galleys before it is discharged overboard. The ship had berthed that morning.
1.3	The two engine room crew were seen collapsed on the deck of the starboard shaft tunnel, just before 09:00, by the Engine Foreman who raised the alarm by phoning 911 (ship internal emergency system) reporting what he had seen and requesting assistance. The Engine Foreman returned to the scene with the First Engineer and the Inventory Technical Specialist, these three people began a rescue attempt before Emergency Teams arrived.
1.4	The initial emergency announcement was made at 09:00 as an Alpha Emergency (medical). At the start of the incident the cause of the engine room crew collapsing was not known nor was it realised that the area was still contaminated with extremely toxic fumes. 
NB The Medical Emergency Team does not respond with Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA).
1.5	When the Medical Emergency Team arrived at the scene, 09:02, a Bravo Emergency (fire/smoke) announcement was immediately requested and made. As the emergency progressed members of the emergency teams and rescuers became affected by the fumes. A staging area for equipment and personnel was set up away from the scene. 
1.6	Assistance was requested, by the ships Operation Control Team, to the port authority. Local emergency services, paramedics and fire department responded swiftly.
1.7	The incident resulted in 3 fatalities, one person was detained in hospital and eighteen others were treated in hospital and released the same day, some required follow up treatment.
The 3 fatalities were the two crew members who removed the pipe and the Engine Foremen who first found them. 
The First Engineer suffered a collapsed lung. 
1.8	The pulper pipe passed through an adjacent fresh water ballast tank (T7017 Dry Tank 11), sections of this pipe line were later discovered to be holed and this had allowed large quantities of food waste to accumulate in the tank. The resulting chemical reaction had caused Hydrogen Sulphide, (H2S) gas to be generated which released during the incident.
1.9	The fresh water ballast tank had previously been a void space and had been re-designated as part of a change in load line. No structural or system changes were made as part of this change of use.

The aft net drum space immediately began to flood through the port transom door, which had been inadvertently left open from the previous voyage.
A port list quickly developed, which worsened as more water poured in through the transom door.  The crew immediately tried to close the open door using the hydraulic ram, but this became damaged by a green sea, and the door could not be closed.
An electric submersible pump, located at the forward end of the net drum space, on the port side began to drain the water.  However, the pump stopped immediately after a flash was observed from the area of the pump and its junction box.  There were six non-return freeing ports, commonly known as tonnage valves, in the net drum space.  These had been welded up by the owners several years before the sinking, due to practical concerns about back-flooding.  There was no other means of clearing the rising flood water in the net drum space.
The crew witnessed water pouring into the galley through open windows in the watertight bulkhead at the forward end of the net drum space.  Water was also latterly seen flowing into the forward cabins.  A window in one of these cabins, leading forward into the fish processing space, was also known to be open, and would have allowed progressive flooding into this space.
As the port list increased, main hydraulic power was lost, resulting in the brakes on the vessel's automatic trawl winch system activating.  With no safe and easy means of releasing these brakes, the vessel was effectively anchored to the seabed on the port side.  Although the trawl warps were cut with an electric grinder, the vessel's condition failed to improve.
Despite some difficulties, the crew managed to deploy the starboard liferaft, and as the list critically increased, the crew abandoned into the liferaft, around 15 minutes after first coming fast.  Shortly afterwards, the vessel capsized, and sank by the stern. Not all crew had been able to put on their lifejackets. A nearby fishing vessel had responded to the earlier ""Mayday"" issued by HARVEST HOPE and safely recovered the crew.

Two derrick lighters were moored alongside the vessel on each side, and cargo operations commenced at 18.48 hours.  The weather was fine with a south-easterly, light to gentle breeze. On 09th July 2005 in the afternoon, the starboard derrick lighter was unloading containers from the No.4 hold and positioning them on the containers stacked two tiers high on the deck at bay 28.  These containers were then offloaded by the port side lighter.  Two stevedores were on top of the container stacks to hook/unhook the four wire slings of the derricks into each container as necessary.  At 15.40 hours, the second mate, who was on the port side of the main deck watching the operations, observed a twenty-foot container being lowered on top of the other containers stacked on deck.  After the two stevedores disconnected the slings from the container, the crane swung clear over to the starboard side.  The second mate then observed the derrick of the port lighter swing towards the container at a relatively fast speed.  One of the legs of the lifting slings caught on the corner of the twenty-foot container, which caused the other slings to begin to spin, wrapping themselves around the fouled leg.  The sling came free and swung rapidly towards the stern. The two stevedores, who were not in the line of sight of the second mate, were climbing down to the main deck.  One of the two had already climbed down from the aft end of the container and was walking away when he heard a loud noise behind him.  On turning around, he saw his colleague lying on the main deck.The Hong Kong authorities were notified of the accident.  The injured stevedore was transferred to the forecastle deck and assisted by the vessel’s crew members.  At 16.20 hours a rescue helicopter arrived near the vessel and a doctor was lowered onto the vessel.  The injured stevedore was evacuated by helicopter at 16.44 hours to the Eastern Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

AURIGA was 3 hours into her second tow when she slowed down. It was felt that possibly a trawl door had dropped, but when attempts to rectify this showed no increase in the vessel's speed, it left the crew with little option other than to haul the gear.
As the trawl wires were hove in, it became apparent that there was an abnormal weight in, or on, the gear. Slowly, recovery of the net continued.
To take the strain off the gear, the Skipper put the vessel into neutral; once in neutral the vessel started to fall off the wind and, as this happened, the weight of the net, suspended from the gantry, affected the vessel's transverse stability, resulting in a dramatic list.
Recognising their perilous situation, the crew abandoned to their liferaft, without having time to transmit a distress or don lifejackets.  Fortunately, AURIGA's EPIRB floated free as the vessel sank and after about an hour in their liferaft, AURIGA's crew were rescued by a passing container ship whose watchkeeper spotted their pinpoint flare.","Fish Catching Vessel","Total loss of the ship","4.42","","","","2","","","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","2007-03-28","2008-06-30"

Initial attempts by the ship’s crew to fight the fire using a fire hose were unsuccessful and the decision was taken to use the engine room Halon 1301 fixed fire extinguishing system. The release of the Halon 1301 proved ineffective, primarily because of the inability of the crew to close the dampers on the ventilation openings at the top of the funnel casing. 

The fire was finally extinguished by the Queensland Fire Service, using high expansion foam injected through a hole cut in the base of the funnel at poop deck level directly above the seat of the fire.

At around 15.35 hours ship’s time (UTC+5), whilst the vessel was 173 nautical miles from Sri Lanka, position at 5º 55.5’N 84º 20.7’E, the ship suddenly developed a list of 15 degrees to port.

The exact cause of the sinking of ‘Hui Long’ could not be established. After investigating the probable causes of the accident, it is believed that the liquefaction of the fluorspar cargo inside the No.1 and No. 3 holds was the cause. The flow state of the fluorspar cargo might have developed a list to the vessel and caused it to capsize and sink.","GENERAL CARGO","Total loss of the ship","12233","Germanischer Lloyd (GL)","16123","","23","","","0","","0","0","","0","2007-06-07",""

It is likely that the electrician was crouching on a deep frame at the lowest level of the engine room so he could reach the light fitting. He may have received an electric shock which knocked him off balance, causing him to fall between the deep frame and an adjacent pipe.

The ship with three experienced yacht persons familiar with the boat on board had left her anchorage off the Danish harbour of Höruphav towards 08:30 a.m. and was sailing on a general course of about 140° with wind from the stern on her way to Kiel. At the time of the accident the helmsman and yachtwoman were staying on deck. According to her observations, shortly after the helmsman had switched on the automatic pilot and had left the port side control   stand going to the cockpit, the yacht fell off to the lee side at 09:05 a.m. with a subsequent accidental gybe. On this occasion the helmsman was hit by the main sheet and thrown against the inner edge of the cockpit. On this occasion he suffered severe injuries. 
The skipper on the yacht, who was made aware of the situation by the joint-sailor’s cry for help, rushed on deck and instructed the joint-sailor to furl the head sail, in order to stabilise the boat and to regain control over it. After he had again gone below deck for a short while, in order to make an emergency call via VHF, he then tried to reanimate the unconscious helmsman until the rescue team would arrive on the scene. Towards 09:20 a.m., a ship of the Federal Police arrived at the scene of the accident. Her crew took the seriously injured victim on board and continued the resuscitation efforts until the rescue ship  Jens Füerschipp, which the MRCC  Bremen had ordered to the scene  of the accident, arrived on the scene. A doctor, who had offered the rescue team of DGzRS his assistance in the port of Gelting Mole and then had accompanied them to the scene of the accident, stated the helmsman’s death at 10:01 a.m.

He immediately rushed aft and saw the skipper holding on to the railing outboard on a level with the cockpit on the port side with one hand. When the co-sailor did not succeed in holding the skipper by the railing, the skipper drifted away from the boat. After a “person over board” manoeuvre the co-sailor succeeded in bringing the man who had fallen over board aft at the boat ladder. At this time the accident victim was already lifeless and could no longer support the rescue attempts. In this condition it was not possible to put the accident victim on board over the boat’s ladder from the stern. That is why he was provisionally secured to the boat ladder with a boat hook and a line. The co-sailor then sent out an emergency call via VHF radio telephone that was heard by several radio stations. After an unsuccessful attempt to recovery, the accident victim drifted off again and was finally recovered at 15:47 hours by the inflatable boat of Warnow and brought on board the Warnow.

During transiting the channel, when the vessel was turning to starboard to enter into the Bocachia Channel, the vessel rolled twice abruptly.

The master drew the attention of the pilots and at the same time the chief mate reported sounds of escaping air from the No.1 port ballast tank vents and that oil was visible in the water on the port side of the vessel.

The vessel started to list to port.

The master requested the senior pilot to take the vessel to the safe outer anchorage. In order to reduce the hydrostatic head of the cargo and minimise the pollution, the master instructed the chief mate to start transferring by gravity the cargo in the No.1 cargo tank to the No. 4 cargo tank, which was empty at the time, 

No.1 starboard ballast tank was ballasted to bring the vessel upright.

At 0822, the vessel dropped anchor at the outer anchorage and a boom was deployed around the vessel to contain any further oil leakages from the vessel.

Spartia was in ballast and making for the port of Bunbury to load alumina. Hannah Lee had departed the small port of Mandurah at 03.45 hours to work its rock lobster pots located approximately 37 nautical miles south-west of the port.

Hannah Lee's skipper failed to observe Spartia in the time leading up to the collision as he was preoccupied with keeping his vessel on course. The bridge team on Spartia had identified the fishing vessel about 20 minutes prior to the collision. They had assessed that a risk of collision existed but, as Hannah Lee was on their port side, they maintained the vessel's course and speed, in accordance with the international collision regulations. When it became obvious to the bridge team that Hannah Lee was not going to give way, the master ordered avoiding action, consisting of a change in course and turn to starboard.

This action was ineffective in preventing the collision and Hannah Lee impacted Spartia's port side, in way of number six hold a short time later. No one was injured in the collision and no pollution resulted.

After the collision, Spartia continued its voyage to Bunbury, where it anchored at 09.00 hours LT. Hannah Lee made for the port of Fremantle where it berthed at a repair yard at about 09.10 hours LT.

2.- La nave se encontraba fondeada en Caleta Potter debido a que durante ese mismo día, había sido inspeccionada por la Autoridad Marítima de Bahía Fildes, por haberse detectado durante la navegación a Punta Arenas, el día 21 de Marzo, una fisura en el Bow thruster, situación que sumada al mal tiempo imperante en la zona, obligó a la nave a regresar al punto de zarpe.  
 
3.- Aproximadamente a las 19:45 horas el Segundo Piloto sube al Puente para  verificar la posición de la nave antes de retirarse a descansar, lo que hizo mediante el sistema GPS, percatándose en ese momento que el buque estaba  garreando, lo cual informó de inmediato al Capitán quien también se encontraba en el Puente.

4.- Se inició el virado de la cadena y se empleó la máquina para ayudar a la maniobra, sin embargo estas acciones no impidieron que la nave fuera abatida hacia la costa del lado sur de la bahía y quedara apoyada sobre el hielo con una escora de 5° a estribor.  Posteriormente se continuó maniobrando con la máquina para tratar de liberarse de los hielos, hasta cerca de las 23:00 horas, momento en que se suspendió la maniobra hasta el día siguiente.

5.- A las 07:10 horas del día 28 de Marzo de 2005 y luego de haber intentado infructuosamente sacar la nave de su posición de varada, el Capitán suspende dichas maniobras e informa lo sucedido a la Capitanía de Puerto de Bahía Fildes.

6.- Finalmente la nave fue desvarada a las 18:05 horas con el apoyo del Rompehielos “ALMIRANTE VIEL” de la Armada de Chile, quedando  fondeada a la gira con seis paños de cadena, dándose por finalizada la maniobra de desvarada.

7.- Con motivo de este siniestro, la nave no derramó hidrocarburos, sufriendo diversas averías en su casco, debiendo posteriormente ser remolcada por otra nave hasta Punta Arenas.

8.-  La varada de la TVH “Chinook”, el 27 de Marzo de 2005, en Caleta Potter, Antártica chilena, se debió a errores humanos cometidos por el  Oficial de Guardia y por el Capitán respectivamente, mientras estuvieron a cargo del control del buque en el puente de mando, debido principalmente a falta de previsión y control de la posición del fondeo de la nave, en los instantes previos a la varada.

The fire spread into part of the accommodation around the engine room areas resulting in the death of the Third Engineer. The incident caused substantial damage to the engine room and the accommodation space.

The investigation revealed that the fire was caused by overflowing fuel oil from the boiler fuel oil tank which came into contact with the main engine hot exhaust gas manifold and ignited. 

Contributing to the cause of the fire was that the filling valve for the boiler fuel oil tank was wrongly opened by the Junior Engineer. This mistake was unfortunately compounded by two major defects on the boiler fuel oil tank system. Firstly, the boiler F.O. return line to the boiler fuel oil tank had been modified leaving behind an opening on the top of the boiler fuel oil tank. Secondly, the overflow line from the boiler fuel oil tank was blocked with rusty debris. As a result, excess fuel oil overflowed from the opening at the top of the tank and came into contact with the hot exhaust trunk.","Bulk Dry (general, ore) Carrier","Loss of life,Ship rendered unfit to proceed","12909","Nippon Kaiji Kyokai (NKK)","21355","dry bulk","20","","","1","","","","","","2007-06-08",""

At 0300 the next morning, the Second Mate of the SUN CROSS contacted the Marshall Islands registered general cargo ship RICKMERS GENOA, which had left the port of Shanghai for the port of Qingdao in China with 12,927.7 tons of cargo. On VHF radio he asked the RICKMERS GENOA to maintain her course and speed.  At the time, the SUN CROSS noticed on radar that the RICKMERS GENOA was approaching from 1.34 miles at one o'clock position on her starboard forward.
At 0302 when the two ships were only 690m apart, the OOW of the SUN CROSS observed the RICKMERS GENOA with the naked eye and put the helm to hard-a-starboard to avoid the imminent collision.  Almost at the same time, the RICKMERS GENOA turned to portside.
At 0303, as the heading of the SUN CROSS pointed to 195degreesT, the portside shell plating in the lower bridge of the SUN CROSS collided with the starboard bow of the RICKMERS GENOA with an intersection angle of 88 degrees.  The SUN CROSS sank right after the collision, leaving thirteen crew members dead or missing and two wounded.
The RICKMERS GENOA suffered severe damages in F'cle, Nos 1 & 2 cargo holds due to the explosion of cargoes caused by the collision, leaving the Chief Mate missing.
Weather conditions : the visibility was limited within 700m with the northwesterly wind at 8-10m/s and a wave height of about 1.5-2m.

KAREN DANIELSEN departed from Svendborg with a pilot on board on 3 March 2005 at 1630 hours bound for Finland, in ballast, with a draft of 4.6 m.

At 1706 hours the pilot informed VTS Great Belt that the vessel was sailing towards Thurø Rev bound for Finland and would pass around Vresen (north of Langeland). After this, it would head south through the Great Belt.

At 1715 hours the pilot left the ship when it was off Thurø. At this time the master and the 2nd officer were on the bridge. The 2nd officer was at the helm.

At 1720 hours the steering was changed to auto pilot. The course was 026° from 1730 hours. 

At 1800 hours the 2nd officer’s duty ended, and he left the bridge at approximately 1805 hours.

At approximately 1815 hours the chief officer came to the bridge and shortly after, the master left to eat. After this, the chief officer was alone on the bridge.

At 1820 hours when KAREN DANIELSEN was off Stokkebaek Flak, the course was altered to 005°. The speed was 11.5 knots. It was twilight and the weather was clear.

At approximately 1857 hours the ship was due to alter to an easterly course to pass north of Langeland according to the passage planning inserted in the GPS. However, the ship continued on a course of 005°.

At approximately 1907 hours KAREN DANIELSEN collided with the western section of the Great Belt Bridge (West Bridge) approximately 800 m from Fyn. The foremast hit the bridge first and was bent astern. Then the forward crane hit and collapsed onto the hatch. After that, the aft crane hit and fell into the water. Finally, the superstructure hit the bridge and the entire wheelhouse was torn off, together with the funnel. 

At 1912 hours the ship transmitted a Mayday distress signal, and the VTS Centre realised that something was wrong.

The VTS Centre called the police, Storebælt A/S (The Great Belt Link) and DSB (Danish Rail), and the traffic over The Great Belt Bridge was stopped. Furthermore, the VTS Centre ordered the guard vessel VTS 3 from Slipshavn to sail towards the bridge.

VTS 3 and the vessel Y 376 took the crew from KAREN DANIELSEN on board and they were brought to Sliphavn. The master was injured severely in the collision and another crewmember was injured during the rescue. The chief officer was missing and a search was organised, but he was not found.

At approximately 0100 hours after the damage to the bridge had been examined, a tug pulled KAREN DANIELSEN clear and the ship was towed to Lindholm Harbour. 

At approximately 0130 hours 4 March, the Great Belt Bridge was reopened for road and rail traffic.

On 4 March at 1240 hours, the chief officer was found dead in the wreckage of the wheelhouse on board the KAREN DANIELSEN. At the post-mortem examination, the result of the alcohol test proved to be at least 1.55 0/00.

Two days earlier on the 3rd February in the port of Leipaya in Latvia the vessel had loaded a cargo of steel reinforcing bars, construction material, and several containers.  
On the 7th February the vessel was to the east of the Faeroe Islands and experiencing strong southerly winds of force 7 to 8 with 4 to 5 metre seas.  She was rolling and pitching moderately and at times heavily in response to the sea conditions.
At approximately 2040 hours (ship's time) on the evening of the 7th February 2005 the vessel experienced a particularly large roll to starboard from which she did not fully recover. 
Minutes later at 2053 hours as the list increased an MF DSC distress alert was sent from the JOKULFELL.
The vessel continued to roll heavily about a rapidly increasing list until she reached an angle of about 90 degrees from where she eventually sank. 
The crew jumped into the sea in their immersion suits.
A Danish Naval vessel, the VAEDDEREN which was operating in the area launched their Lynx rescue helicopter and recovered 5 survivors from the JOKULFELL at about 2344.  
The bodies of 4 other crew members were recovered from the sea the next day but 2 crew members have not been located and are presumed to have gone with the ship.

During the early hours of Wednesday 02 February 2005, the vessel was approaching the western coast of Ogasawara Islands.  The northerly wind had increased to gale force.  Just before 0600, the navigational OOW saw a streak of flash lightning running on the main deck in way of amidships.  A strong shock was immediately felt throughout the ship and it was noticed that the MV Aurelia took a severe trim by the head.  A distress message was sent by INMARSAT C and COSPAS-SARSAT.  The general alarm was sounded followed by a public address to the crew.  At around 06.15 hours LT, the master ordered the crew to abandon the vessel.

The starboard lifeboat was first swung out and six crewmembers, including the master, jumped on board.  During lowering, the forward fall jammed and the boat was left suspended against the ship’s side.  Almost immediately, the lifeboat was hit by a high wave, causing the lifeboat to crash against the vessel’s hull and tossing the crew members into the water.  Several other crewmembers abandoned the ship on board the ship’s liferafts.

Several hours later, a Japanese Coast Guard aircraft spotted the drifting survivors.  At around 13.00 hours LT, all survivors were airlifted and transported to Japan via Iwojima Naval Base for a medical check-up.
