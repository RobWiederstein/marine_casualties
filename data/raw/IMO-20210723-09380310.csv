The vessel was scheduled to load 164,000 tonnes of iron ore for China. On 24 December, while at anchor, the vessel deballasted ballast tanks nos. 1 and 4 (port and starboard) in order to reduce the number of ballast tanks which she would have to deballast, once alongside when loading operations would start. The vessel then berthed in the evening of 25 December and since loading had not started, the chief mate opted to strip the ballast tanks that had been emptied during the day before. On completion at 2330, he advised the engine-room to line up the ballast system so that deballasting could take place when loading started. Loading started at 0229 on 26 December and the chief mate instructed the engine-room to prepare for deballasting operations; this required the starting of an additional generator. The chief mate then opened the remote suction valves to ballast tanks nos. 2 port and starboard. Soon afterwards, a loud bang was heard and the vessel blacked out. Power was eventually restored and the crew discovered a spray of water coming from the ballast pump suction strainer cover that was reaching the electrical distribution panel located close to the strainer. Water was steadily rising in the engine-room bilges. Despite isolating the ballast system, about 1,100 tonnes of sea water flooded into the engine-room. The ballast pump strainer cover and a ballast valve appeared to have been damaged when valves to ballast tanks port & starboard nos. 2 were opened. A number of electrical motors, switchboards, cabling, as well as the disabling of the main engine was directly attributed to the ingress of seawater into the engine-room. The vessel was subsequently towed to Singapore where the vessels equipment was overhauled and refitted.","Bulk Dry (general, ore) Carrier","Ship rendered unfit to proceed","87390","Bureau Veritas (BV)","172579","Dry bulk","22","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","2019-12-31",""

Quezon, Philippines","1","0","Capsizing / listing","On or about 1115H Local Time (LT) of 21 December 2017, M/V MERCRAFT 3 capsize and sank between the vicinity of Dinahican Point and Agta Point at the position of LAT: 14°42'N, LONG: 121°47'E while navigating at Lamon Bay towards Polillo Islands.
By way of background, M/V MERCRAFT 3 was originally scheduled to depart at around 0615H OF 21 December 2017, based on her approved sailing schedules reflected on her Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC),  but was delayed due to the weather condition brought by the northeast monsoon (Amihan). Accordingly, no Public Storm Warning Signals (PSWS) had been raised in the area during the time of the casualty. Nevertheless, based on Gale Warning No. 59 issued by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) on 5:00 am of 21 December 2017,  the eastern seaboards of southern Luzon including the island Polillo are expected to experience strong to gale force winds with wave height measuring 2.8 to 4.5 meters. 
At around 0913H of 21 December 2017, M/V MERCRAFT 3 finally departed the port of Ungos, Real Quezon under voyage No. 01 bound to Polillo Port carrying 251 passengers and seven (7) crew compliments. The 206.27 tons Fiberglass Reinforced Plastic (FRP) hulled catamaran passenger vessel was cruising at a speed of 10.5 knots due to the prevailing sea conditions at the time.

At around 0955H, while plying between the area of Dinahican Pt. and Agta Pt. in the area called “Kasiligan”, MV MERCRAFT 3 was battered by steep waves and subsequently hit a hard floating object on her starboard bow.The Master of the vessel immediately reduced their speed to 4 knots in order to assess the situation. Consequently, due to the reduction of the vessel’s propulsion, MV MERCRAFT 3 failed to compensate with the prevailing wave motion at the time, thus positioning her bow under the bottom of the trough instead on top of the crest of the wave. MV MERCRAFT 3 was slammed by second steep breaking waves on her forward section displacing the crates of deck cargoes and prompting it to collided with the stud bolt lock securing the fore peak hatches (P/S). Thus, prompting the ingress on water on her main deck. Furthermore, several of the medical oxygen cylinders stowed on the fore section was disentangled from its securing attachments.

As a result of the incident, the hatch covers were dislodged and sea water started to enter the forepeak compartments (P/S) when the flair of the bow is acted upon and pushed downward whileMV MERCRAFT 3 is subjected to heavy pitching and surging motion.

Consequently, MV MERCRAFT 3 develops an initial list of 5° to starboard, while being continuous battered by 3-5 meter breaking waveson her port. The Master tries to maneuver the vessel to hard port in order to shelter her broadside from windward direction and irregular waves.In addition, portable submersible pumps were used by the crew to pump out sea water on the fore peak compartments, but was ineffective due to the inflow of sea water while being subjected to pitching and surging motion.
Accordingly, the FRP Catamaran passenger vessel was having difficulty in maneuvering to port due to the drag produced by her flooded starboard forward compartment and considerable windage at her port side. To prevent further ingress of water, the Master tried to maneuver the vessel to astern. However, it was discern that the hatch covers at the aft manhole access (P/S) leading to engine room no. 2 was left open. This incited sea water to enter and flood engine room no. 2 every time the vessel maneuvers astern.

The vessel was afloat for almost one (1) hour trying to stabilize her position while awaiting rescue. On or about 1100H the Master gave the command to abandon ship, every passenger was ushered by the crew to wear their life jacket and jump in the water. Fifteen (15) minutes after the evacuation, MV MERCRAFT 3 capsizeson her starboard side and sank at approximately 7 NM off Dinahican Pt.","Passenger Ship","Loss of life,Total loss of the ship","206","Filipino Vessels Classification Society","","","7","251","0","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","2018-07-19",""

After departure, the crew members on deck began to tidy up in preparation for sea passage. On the aft deck, the mooring lines that had been used while the ship was in port were being secured on the two mooring winches. During the final stage of the securing process, the last mooring line on the port side winch, the AB who arranged the mooring line on the winch drum assisted by one deck cadet, was caught in the winch and dragged into the limited clearance between the reeled-in mooring rope on the winch drum and the deck underneath. This happened within only a few seconds, while the assisting cadet had approached the AB who was operating the winch to convey the message to stop reeling in. The AB got crushed between the deck and the mooring rope and consequently he was severely injured. He was later pronounced dead by a medical doctor on board a Coast Guard vessel, which had come to assist and evacuate the casualty. The safety investigation of the fatal accident revealed that in order to perform the task of stowing the mooring ropes on the winch drum, the crew members had to engage physically with the ropes while the winch was rotating, to stow it properly and make room for all of the rope. The close proximity to the rotating winch and physical interaction made it possible to get caught. Furthermore, communication among the crew members easily became ineffective due to the setup of the mooring arrangement and loud noises on the aft mooring deck.","Bulk Dry (general, ore) Carrier","Loss of life","28718","RINA Services S.p.A (RINA)","50992","Dry bulk","24","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","2019-12-31",""

The accident occurred when the ships ordinary seaman went over the main deck to assist the apprentice who had suffered an injury to his foot that got caught by the door when entering the engine room. The ordinary seaman most likely fell overboard as a wave washed over the deck. The crew member was found and rescued with the MOB-boat, and transported to Haukeland Hospital by helicopter. The person was declared deceased at the hospital the following day. ysund has a typical wellboat design with a low freeboard in loaded condition, which often leads to water on the main deck in rough sea. ysund was equipped with an elevated walkway (storm bridge) over the main deck, but about of this consisted of the vessel's gangway. The storm bridge did not meet the requirements of the Load Line Convention, and the crew did not experience it as safe to use in rough sea conditions. The Norwegian Maritime Directorate has informed that they are preparing a circular on this issue and that they will have more focus on enforcing the relevant provision. ysund has received an instruction to improve the storm bridge to comply with regulatory requirements. The investigation has shown that the wellboat company and the ship management had not implemented measures to reduce the risk for crew being located on the main deck in rough sea. There were no established procedures or guidelines for the crew being on the main deck, nor the use of communication equipment or personal safety equipment when staying or working on the main deck. Furthermore, there were several actions during the rescue operation that were not performed according to the ship procedures. This might be because the crew was not well trained in carrying out realistic MOB-boat exercises. The Norwegian accident investigation board issues two safety recommendations to the wellboat company as a result of the investigation.","Fish Catching Vessel","Loss of life","1718","","2200","","7","0","","1","0","0","0","0","0","2019-07-25",""

The information is supported by the vessels AIS track, which shows that no course corrections were made following the turn. After the vessel ran aground, both of the nautical officers were arrested by the police and taken ashore, as a result of which the vessel was without a nautical officer in charge for some time. The cause of the accident was deficiencies in the monitoring of the navigation due to the master falling asleep during his watch on the bridge and because there was no lookout. Contributing causes to the master falling asleep included an accumulated sleep deficit and the fact that he was working on a two-watch system, which had likely contributed to the sleep deficit over a longer period of time. The master was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the grounding. Furthermore, the Bridge Navigation Watch Alarm System (BNWAS) had been turned off, which could have prevented the master from falling asleep or at least alerted the rest of the crew. A contributing cause to the lack of a lookout on the bridge was the vessels limited crew, in combination with the shipping companys ISM providing insufficient support to the master, which had not been noted in the classification reviews of the shipping company and the vessel.","General Cargo Ship","Ship rendered unfit to proceed","2195","RINA Services S.p.A (RINA)","","","8","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","2021-03-10",""

In an attempt to guide the lift back on to the cargo deck for aborting the operation, the Master of Coastlink 8 handed the steering control of the vessel to another crew member and went out of the wheelhouse. While assisting to adjust the cargo net to its original position, the cargo net got lifted off the main deck and swung towards the transit vessel.

The Master although warned by the other crew to stay clear was hit by the swinging lift and thrown overboard. A search and rescue operation was launched but his body could not be found, until four days later, and eventually recovered by Singapore Police Coast Guard at the sea off Marina South Pier.

The TSIB classified the occurrence as a Very Serious Marine Casualty and launched an investigation.

With rising temperatures and increasing quantities of toxic gas and despite attempts at cooling the decomposition front with water, the situation worsened.
Prevailing still weather conditions, danger to personnel caused by the toxic gas cloud and a rapid deterioration of the on-board situation ultimately resulted in the Master ordering evacuation from the vessel. Spain MRCC responded using two search and rescue helicopters and successfully landed the crew and cargo surveyor in Las Palmas.
The vessel, being no longer under command or power, drifted (under MRCC supervision) in a South-Westerly direction further away from land whilst the decomposition continued.

Following the successful completion of the cargo operation, the crew members started the ballasting of the vessel since her next trip to Spain was a ballast voyage. Ballasting in the forepeak tank started under the supervision of the second mate.

About an hour later, at about 1300, a high bilge level alarm in the bow thruster compartment sounded on the vessel s Alarm Monitoring System. The bosun proceeded forward to investigate. He immediately noticed water escaping from the forepeak tank s manhole, reaching the bow thruster entrance, flowing over the sill plate and cascading on the bow thruster motor. Consequently, one of the bilge alarms in the bow thruster compartment triggered the high level alarm.

Aware of possible issues with the bow thruster motor, the chief engineer instructed the electrician to inspect the motor for any water damages. Prior to the commencement of the work, three safety documents were signed. The bow thruster electrical supply to the ventilation fan and the bow thruster motor was isolated. As part of the cleaning process, the electrician sprayed the motor with an electrical cleaner using a pneumatic spray gun. He then proceeded to the messroom and returned to the bow thruster compartment at around 1600. About 20 minute later, the bosun went to check on the electrician and found him unconscious, lying over the bow thruster tunnel.

At 2000 on 12 August 2017, the fishing vessel Mako departed San Remo, Victoria, bound for fishing grounds about 3 hours away. Once clear of Cape Woolamai, Mako maintained a steady course (210°) and speed to the south-west. At the same time, the container ship Glasgow Express was passing Cape Liptrap heading north-west. The ship was bound for Melbourne, Victoria, and was maintaining a steady course (299°) and speed. From about 2030 the vessels were on a collision course.
No avoiding action was taken by either vessel and, at about 2246, they collided.

What the ATSB found
The ATSB found that a proper lookout by ‘all available means’ was not being maintained on either vessel. 
Glasgow Express’s bridge team saw and monitored Mako visually from about 2200. However, a full appraisal of the situation using other instruments or means available on the bridge (such as radar) was not done. As a consequence, the situation was misinterpreted and the risk of collision was not identified. Therefore, no avoiding action was taken.
Prior to handing over the watch at 2230, Mako’s watchkeeper identified Glasgow Express by radar and visually. However, the information was misinterpreted and it was concluded that the Glasgow Express was passing clear, ahead of the fishing boat, and no avoiding action was taken. Then, after taking the watch, Mako’s second watchkeeper did not see the Glasgow Express until moments before the collision. 
In addition, Mako was under way with all external lights on. This made the vessel more easily seen, but reduced the ability for Glasgow Express’s bridge team to accurately visually appraise the situation. The bright lights also reduced Mako’s watchkeeper’s night vision and ability to distinguish features beyond the glare of the lights.
The ATSB also noted that Mako, similar to other fishing vessels of this design, had a large fishing net winch drum mounted on deck forward of the wheelhouse. This winch drum restricts forward vision and may limit the ability to maintain a proper lookout unless accounted for in on-board procedures and training.

What's been done as a result
Glasgow Express’s operator undertook a fleet-wide information and education program which outlined the incident and emphasised the need to use all available means to maintain safe navigation in accordance with the collision regulations.

Safety message
The ATSB continues to see collisions between trading ships and small vessels. A common contributing factor has been the failure to use all available means to accurately appraise a situation and the risk of collision. 
The ATSB reinforces to masters, owners, operators and skippers of all vessels the importance of a proper lookout by all available means including radar. Proper use of radar equipment including long range scanning and radar plotting allows for early detection, assessment and warning of vessels posing a risk of collision. This allows the watchkeeper sufficient time to take early and considered action to avoid collision in accordance with the International regulations for preventing collisions at sea, 1972 (as amended) (COLREGs).

Ipag, Mariveles, Bataanat the position of LAT: 14-25.17N, LONG: 120-27.25while on a course heading at 317°.
LCT Blue Hawk 88 departed the port of Bogo, Cebu on 1526 LT of 24 July 2017, under full ballast condition and no cargo onboard. Her draft condition prior to departure consists of FWD: 0.80 M: 1.80 AFT: 2.80.
Initially, The 1,857 GT steel hulled deck loading barge was on her intended course to Manila under voyage No. 186when she was advised by the charterer to change her course headingtowards Subic for possible loading operation. While on passage in the vicinity of Fortune Island, LCT Blue Hawk 88 began to alter her course heading from 348° to 350°near La Monja Island.
Accordingly, whilston passagenear La Monja Island (LAT. 14°22.5’N, LONG. 120°27.8’E),LCT Blue Hawk 88 began to experience moderate to heavy weather in the area and was intensely battered by huge waves, swells and heavy rains coming towards her port bow. 
At around 1630 LT of 27 July 2017, after reaching her next way point, she set her course to 317° at Napo Pt., a sudden strong gale with Beufort Scale 8/9, approximately 41-47 knots with strong winds coming from the westerly direction lashes towards LCT Blue Hawk 88. The Master of the vessel ordered to maneuver the vessel leeward away from the waves and near the shorein order to shelter the vessel from windward direction and irregular waves. 
Consequently, due to the south east direction of the gale, the weather created a lee shore prompting any vessel with low maneuverability to increase her leeway towards the shore.

Conversely, while on hard port rudder and full ahead engine, LCT Blue Hawk 88 began to drift broadside to starboard towards the rocky shores. With the wind and waves veering on her port side, the Master ordered the crew to drop her starboard anchor in order to positionher bow towards the sea.  LCT Blue Hawk 88 began to swing her stern counter clockwise, placing her bow towards the sea and her stern in the direction of the reefs.  However, the 83 meter cargo vessel started to drag her anchor and continue to drift astern towards the rocky shores of Brgy. Ipag, Mariveles, Bataan. 

At around 1825 LT of 27 July 2017, a sudden loud clank from the propeller was followed by a strong vibration from the stern was experienced by the crew indicating that the vessel hadstranded on the rocky portions of the reef. Thereafter, thevessel quickly turns to port along with her starboard anchor being drag parallel to the shore.
The Master immediately ordered to stop all engines as sea water started to enter and flood the engine room. The Mastered ordered all the crew to muster at the bridge while the vessel was continuously being pounded by strong waves on her starboard quarter. The crew immediately call for rescue and informed the company of the occurrence. All of the crew onboard manages to make it safely to shore the following day and medical assistance was rendered by the local rescue unit of Mariveles. 
The vessel remained aground for almost 2 days and, due to adverse weather conditions, she was pounded heavily onto the rocky foreshore. This caused material damage to her hull and breaching of the double bottom structure. On the 29th of July 2017, LCT Blue Hawk 88 broke in half with stress fractures emanating on her midship, the vessel was then declared a total loss by the owner and was consequently coordinating with the Insurance for wreck removal by a registered Salvor Company. There were no reported oil spill or fatalities involved in the incident.

The person was wedged in between the vessel's winch (triplex) and the wheelhouse bulkhead, during hauling of the fishing gear. A railing behind the triplex would have impeded access to the danger area. The railing was a part of the initial construction drawings, but not delivered. Neither the designer, the shipyard, the shipping company nor the authorities revealed the missing railing and signage in the area between the seine tube and wheelhouse bulkheads, during construction or at the completion of the vessel. Subsequent regulatory checks after the vessel came into operation took place alongside a quay, and did not capture the missing railing and associated danger area. Challenges of the lines being spun during hauling occurred after the vessel came into fishing. The crew established a practice for work in this danger zone where the skipper and the person overseeing the lines had visual and oral communication. Interference from one of the vessel's VHF radios caused the skipper to leave the manoeuvring position, thus losing the visual control of the engineer. A possible misunderstanding in the communication led to the skipper starting the hauling process without necessary visual control restored. The company's safety management system prior to the accident was considered deficient in documented risk assessments, measures and work instructions. After the accident, the company established several physical barriers and improved safety routines. The investigation has shown that the current regulations for the construction of vessels place few requirements on possible danger zones in the operation of fishing gear, and the authorities consider to a lesser extent operational safety at this stage. In previous investigations, the AIBN has also pointed out that it is crucial that work processes are evaluated during the design phase. The company's expectations to the participants in the design and construction phase were unclarified regarding their opportunities for influencing operational safety. The AIBN sees the importance of an extensive collaboration between vessel owners, designers and construction yards focusing on operational issues in the upcoming operational phase. The Accident Investigation Board Norway does not issue any safety recommendations after the investigation.","Fish Catching Vessel","Loss of life","498","","0","","8","0","","1","0","0","0","0","0","2019-11-25",""

Both vessels were damaged in the collision but were able to proceed to nearby ports for damage assessment. The accident did not result in any injuries or pollution.

The safety investigation identified that a VHF radio conversation between the vessels had resulted in the two bridge teams holding conflicting views as to what had been agreed regarding the large bulk carrier overtaking the oil tanker. Subsequently, the oil tanker’s bridge team did not check for sea room astern before altering course, leading to a close quarter situation between the two vessels. The oil tanker’s master had been present on the bridge for over 14 hours and was probably suffering from fatigue, which was likely to have had an adverse effect on his decision making.","Oil Tanker","Ship rendered unfit to proceed","30241","[Other]","48580","Liquid cargo - Oil","24","0","0","","","","","","","2020-01-29",""

At about 1250, the second mate arrived on the bridge and made his way to the chartroom to write the logbook. At the time, the master had the con. Approximately one minute later, Freyja was in the open water segment of the voyage, approaching waypoint no. 3. The next course to steer was 316 degrees. The course was altered to starboard and the master switched on the autopilot. The vesse's speed was increased to 10 knots. Gently turning to starboard, Freyja settled on a heading of 336. A few minutes later, the master called the second mate to check the soundings. As the latter reported the water depths, the master became concerned, switched to manual steering and strived to steer the vessel clear of the shallows. At 1255/20s, Freyja ran aground in position 61 35.83' N 004 58.13 E.

The crew was waiting for Wiper, Oleksandr Chernyshenko to be present so the meeting could start. He did not turn up. After waiting for a few minutes, the 3rd Engineer called him on the telephone but there was no response. He then went to his cabin but he was not there and the cabin door was unlocked. The 3rd Engineer then checked other cabins and he was not to be found. It would appear that he was missing on board. 

At 1630 hours on the same day, the Master mustered all crew members and mounted a thorough search on board the ship for him. The search was carried out until 1930 hours (LT) on board with 45 minutes break for dinner and the usual D&A test conducted at 1800 hours. The crew checked and searched all the cabins including all store rooms, all bilges, corners and void spaces, in Engine Room, on deck and in the funnel, he was not to be found. There were no witnesses of his missing.  
The last time the Wiper was seen on board was by the Oiler 3 at 0330 hours on 28 May 2017.  He was seen on the alleyway of Deck B near his cabin when Oiler 3 was going on watch in the Engine Room.  
The statements of fact were taken from all crew members by the Master for the period from 1600 hours on 27 May 2017 till the time the Wiper was discovered missing. He was seen by various crew members on various occasions and places on board from 1600 hours on 27 May 2017 till 0330 hours on 28 May 2017. He was seen on upper deck, ER, during dinner time, alleyway of Deck A, TV room, and crew mail computer. 
From dinner time till 2330 hours on 27 May 2017, the Wiper was watching TV with 4th Engineer and the Oiler 3 (his friend). He also used the crew mail computer near the ship’s office on Deck A.
From 2300 hours on 27 May 2017 till 0330 hours on 28 May 2017, nobody had seen him. At 0330 hours on 28 May 2017, the Wiper was last seen by Oiler 3 in alleyway of Deck B going to his cabin.

The ship was loaded with the cargo of 7268 tons of Gas Oil and Fiel Oil.
The navigational officer of the watch at 1043LT noticed the activation of the engine-room fire alarm and immediately phoned the engine control room to alert the engineering officer of the watch. The engineers took immediate action and confirmed that main engine was on fire.
Due to the intensity of the fire and the dense smoke, attempts to extinguish the fire with portable fire extinguishers could prove futile. Consequently, the engine-room had to be abandoned and prepared for CO2 release. 
The fire was eventually brought under control and extinguished after the activation of the fixed CO2 installation. No evacuation of the crew was needed. 
The Transport Accident and Incident Investigation Bureau (TAIIB) determines that the probable cause of fire on board the ZIRCON was the spray of fuel oil on a hot surface and igniting, following the fracture of the securing screw on the low pressure fuel supply pipes flange, located on the main engine.","Oil Tanker","Ship rendered unfit to proceed","5045","RINA Services S.p.A (RINA)","8000","Liquid cargo - Other liquid","17","0","0","","","","","","","2018-03-07",""

The collision occurred in the East-bound deep water route of the traffic separation scheme (TSS) off Batu Berhanti.

Gortynia sustained major damage to her port side forward ballast tanks both above and below the waterline. The vessel also sustained varying degrees of damage to the port side hull and deck fittings from cargo hold no. 1 to just forward of the accommodation. DZ Qingdao also sustained major damages to her bow. Both vessels were able to proceed to an anchorage, off Singapore where the respective damages were assessed.

The safety investigation concluded that prior to DZ Qingdao suffering a power loss resulting in a temporary loss of propulsion and steering, both vessels were approaching each other in their respective traffic separation lanes and were to pass clear of each other.  The change in DZ Qingdao s heading and speed meant that she now was at risk of collision with Gortynia as they approached each other.  This change was not noted on board Gortynia as the bridge team were only monitoring AIS targets on its radars, and with the loss of power on board DZ Qingdao, the AIS transmission ceased, causing the loss of the AIS plot.

DZ Qingdao did not warn VTIS and the surrounding vessels that she was not under command and as a result when the change in heading was detected by Gortynia, at a very late stage, this did not allow her  to take effective avoiding action in time to avoid the collision.","Bulk Dry (general, ore) Carrier","Ship rendered unfit to proceed","93297","Bureau Veritas (BV)","182608","Solid cargo - Dry bulk","22","0","0","","","","","","","2018-11-15",""

The first crew member to notice the fire on the main engine was the vessel s electrician and promptly alerted other crew members, although no alarm was activated. The main engine was stopped by the chief engineer, who tried to extinguish the fire with a portable CO2 fire extinguisher. Eventually, the fire alarm automatically activated at 1030 (LT).

Eventually, the flames and heavy smoke overwhelmed the crew members and the fire was deemed uncontrollable. Consequently, the engine-room was evacuated at 1035 and all crew members mustered on the poop deck. At around 1110, the fire was extinguished using the vessel s fixed CO2 system. The vessel was towed to Istanbul, Tuzla to affect permanent repairs.

The immediate cause of the fire was identified to be a spray of fuel oil and diesel oil (IFO / MDO) mixture on the hot turbo charger housing.","Oil Tanker","Ship rendered unfit to proceed","4798","RINA Services S.p.A (RINA)","7124","Liquid cargo - Oil","17","0","0","","","","","","","2018-05-02",""

One of them was fatally injured.

The investigation revealed that the tail rope of the mooring line had been seized using a seizing twine to make a smaller eye (bight) for the purpose of securing onto smaller bollards ashore. As the ship’s crew slackened two of the three mooring lines (on the same bollard), the seizing twine of the mooring line that had likely taken load, parted, while the tail of the mooring line was intact. As a result, the opened up bight of the tail of the mooring line struck two workers who were preparing to release the slackened mooring lines from the bollard.

Immediately thereafter an emergency announcement was made and all crew mustered.

The fire was spreading quickly among other containers and while the main engine had been stopped, all crew were engaged in the fire fighting using fire hoses.	

A tug arrived to the scene approximately two hours after and started spraying water on the fire in the starboard side. Another tug boat arrived soon after but was unable to spray water due to a technical problem on the fire fighting system.

	The MSC DANIELA was diverted to the nearest port of Colombo in Sri Lanka road where other tugboats would join to spray water onto the smoky and burning containers.

The fire resulted in minor damages to the hull, deck and pontoons as well as localised fittings on the upper deck.

Despite a brief search of localised areas of the vessel by his colleagues, he had not been located. 

The vessel conducted a full search of the vessel and returned to the geographical position corresponding to the time at which the person had last been sighted on the vessel. This was later supplemented by assistance from Egyptian naval vessels and an aircraft. 

The search carried on throughout the rest of the day and into the later evening. After sunset, the likelihood of sighting a person in the water became improbable and the vessel called off its search and resumed passage to Jeddah. 

The incident was reported to the relevant authorities as a man overboard (MoB) incident. 

The marine safety investigation recognised that during the course of the investigation several aspects of the vessel's Safety Management System had latent procedural shortcomings in relation to 3rd party contractors.

Both vessels were heading West bound from South China Sea and about to enter the West bound TSS at the Eastern entrance of the Singapore Strait when they collided. The Master of the MV Global Vanguard was on the bridge and in command at the time of the collision.  

At 0345 hours, the vessel MV Thor Achiever, a bulk carrier, was some 1.5 nautical miles on the starboard quarter of the MV Global Vanguard. The MV Thor Achiever was doing a speed of about 13.5 knots and the MV Global Vanguard’s speed was 12.2 knots. They were heading to enter the Westbound lane of the TSS in the Singapore Strait. By 0400 hours it became apparent the MV Thor Achiever was an overtaking vessel. The two vessels were approaching close to each other in an overtaking situation. The MV Thor Achiever was on the starboard quarter of the MV Global Vanguard and closing in to overtake the MV Global Vanguard on her port side and 0.4 nautical mile away. At 0415 hours the MV Thor Achiever was abeam of MV Global Vanguard about 0.4 nautical mile away. And at 0420 hours, MV Thor Achiever overtook the MV Global Vanguard and was slightly forward of the beam of the MV Global Vanguard. Soon after this time, the MV Thor Achiever appeared to suddenly altered course to port. This put the two vessels in a collision course. The MV Global Vanguard had no room to manuoever to port as they were other vessels in the vicinity. A collision situation was imminent. 

At about 0423 hours, three minutes later, the two vessels collided. At the time of collision the weather was fine and the visibility was good and clear with light breeze. The speed of the MV Global Vanguard was about 10.8 knots. The other vessel MV Thor Achiever’s speed was also about 10.8.knots. On board the MV Global Vanguard, the radars were in operation and in working order. The impact of the collision caused damage to MV Global Vanguard starboard side in way of No.1 Hatch and breached the starboard cargo bilges with ingress of water. The vessel also sustained damage to the shell plating on her starboard quarter in way of starboard No. 1 & 2 oil waste tanks. However, There was no leakeage of oil and hence no oil pollution. 

There was no information as to any damage to MV Thor Achiever. The MV Global Vanguard proceeded to a safe anchorages after the accident as instructed by the VTIS centre. 

Soon after the collision the MV Global Vanguard tried to call the  MV Thor Achiever on the VHF Channels 16 and 10 but there was no response.

On completion of a scheduled routine Man Overboard drill and while following the navigation plan the vessel went aground shortly after midday on an unchartered reef to the north west of Kri Island. Immediately on identifying the vessel was aground the Master initiated grounding procedures and informed the necessary authorities. It was determined that the vessel was unable to free itself from the reef, particularly whilst on an ebbing tide therefore tug assistance was requested in an attempt to re-float off the reef at the next high tide. 

The vessel was re-floated approximately 10 hours later and with the assistance of divers and regular internal soundings confirmed that the hull was not breached and on initial assessment minimal structural damage.

Because it was dark and there were no external visual navigation aids, the bridge team was using only the ship’s electronic navigation systems to conduct the pilotage.

As the ship was making a turn off Dale Point, the pilot lost awareness of exactly where the ship was, the direction in which it was heading and the effects of the wind and tide on the ship.

The L’Austral deviated well off the planned track and struck a stony bank near the shoreline of Milford Sound. The ship suffered scraping and indentation of the hull on its starboard side, but the hull was not breached and nobody on board was injured.

The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found that the ship’s crew on the bridge noticed the ship was off its planned track, but did not bring this to the pilot’s attention until it was too late to avert the grounding.

The Commission found that the bridge team were not making full use of the ship’s electronic navigation systems to ensure that the ship stayed on track.

The Commission identified three safety issues:
- the primary means for navigation on board the L’Austral, the electronic chart display and information system, was not being used to its full potential as a tool for planning and monitoring the ship’s passage, and the crew were not fully conversant with its safety features
- the standard of bridge resource management on board the L’Austral during the Milford Sound pilotage did not meet good industry practice
- conducting ‘blind pilotage’ with large ships in confined waters represented risks that had not been fully considered by Environment Southland, the regional authority that regulates maritime activity in the area.

The Commission repeated two previous recommendations to the ship’s operator (Compagnie des Iles du Ponant) and made one new recommendation to Environment Southland to address the safety issues.

The Commission had previously found that poor bridge resource management under pilotage was a factor contributing to accidents involving two other ships in New Zealand. Their two reports had made several recommendations aimed at improving the standard of pilotage and making the transition of the pilot into the ship’s bridge team seamless.

Key lessons arising from this inquiry were:
- a ship’s passage plan is more than just the planned track for the ship to follow. Every part of a ship’s voyage must be planned and all members of the bridge team be fully familiar with and agree to the plan. This is a cornerstone of good bridge resource management
- good bridge resource management relies on a culture where challenge is welcomed and responded to, regardless of rank, personality or nationality
- an electronic chart display and information system is a valuable aid to navigation. However, mariners need to fully understand and be familiar with all aspects of the system, particularly when using it for blind pilotage.","Passenger/Cruise","Ship remains fit to proceed","10944","","1441","","144","200","","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","2020-04-14",""

The ship was secured to mooring bollards on the wharf using its own mooring lines.
1.2. During the day the weather changed rapidly and earlier than predicted. The wind increased in intensity and changed direction so as to push the ship away from the wharf. As a result, a number of mooring bollards on the wharf progressively failed by tearing from the wharf.
1.3. The resulting load on the remaining mooring lines caused them to break, and the stern of the ship swung across the harbour and collided with a bulk cement carrier that was in the process of berthing at an adjacent wharf. The Seabourn Encore’s crew were able to establish power to the ship’s propulsion systems in time to lessen the impact and to maintain control of the ship until the wind abated enough to re-secure the ship to its berth with the aid of a harbour pilot and tugs.
1.4. As well as the damage to the wharf, the hull of the bulk cement carrier was holed near the waterline, but the damage occurred where a water ballast tank was located so did not materially affect the ship’s stability.

While conducting painting and routine touch-up work in the cargo holds, deck crewmembers were using a mobile scaffold tower. As the scaffold tower was moved with two unsecured crewmembers still on the upper tiers, it became unbalanced and toppled forward onto the deck.  

The ATSB found that by remaining on the unsecured scaffold tower in preparation for repositioning, contrary to established procedures, the two crewmembers had rendered it top-heavy and unstable. Consequently, when moved, it toppled and fell. Additionally, neither crewmember on the scaffold tower utilised the required safety harness and associated safety lines which would have prevented them falling when climbing or working on the tower. 

This investigation report highlights the importance of adhering to procedures that assure safety as well as the value of effective supervision. Ship owners, operators and crewmembers are reminded to plan and undertake risk assessments for assigned tasks in order to identify any shortcomings in procedures and required risk-mitigation measures.

Around midnight they departed Lødingen and sailed southward in Vestfjorden. The weather was bad with rain and strong winds from South-southwest. They got the wind and sea on the starboard side and the skipper decided to slow down the speed a little to adjust to the weather.
At about 0500 am the ""no rudder response"" alarm sounded. The crew perceived from the rudder indicator that the rudder had locked up on 15º starboard and they implemented several measures to correct this. It has not been possible for the Accident Investigation Board Norway (AIBN) to determine why the rudder ceased to work.
AIBN considers that the skipper, together with the crew, and in dialogue with the Rescue Coordination Center (RCC), implemented the necessary measures after they perceived that the rudder had locked. The skipper started the side-thrusters forward and aft in order to try to keep the bow up against the weather, but the wind and the sea was too strong. Due to the bad weather conditions, the problem with the rudder lead the vessel to drift towards land and they slowly approached a critical situation.
At about 0700 am a helicopter rescued the crew of six. None of the crew was hurt in connection with the accident and the rescue operation.
After the crew was rescued, the vessel drifted uncontrollably by wind and sea, passing through an area of shallow waters with rocks, landslides and slopes. At 1117 am Fisktrans shipwrecked outside Brennvika. It is uncertain whether the massive damages in the hull, below the intact waterline, occurred because of the collision with the seabed or when it passed through the area of shallow waters with rocks, landslides and slopes.
The AIBN does not promote any safety recommendations in connection with this investigation.","Fish Catching Vessel","Ship rendered unfit to proceed,Total loss of the ship","969","","","","6","","","","","","","","","2017-11-01",""

Although the bulk carrier was advised by VTIS to wait for the westbound traffic to clear, which included the tanker, the bulk carrier misidentified another vessel to be the tanker while attempting to cross the TSS. During this time, the tanker, was attempting an overtaking maneuver.

The investigation revealed gaps in navigation relating to bridge resource management and identified issues pertaining to appropriate bridge team composition when navigating in areas of higher traffic density and compliance with COLREGs.

As a result of the collision, the tanker reported loss of fuel oil as a result of breach of fuel oil tank while the bulk carrier suffered damage to its bow and lost its anchor.

Consequently, the cargo deck crane s combined unit and jib parted from the pedestal base and fell on the jetty, coming in contact with the cargo hold hatch cover and main deck railings.

Discharging operations were suspended and the managers arranged for the cargo to be discharged by shore cranes. The remaining cranes on board were also thoroughly inspected.

The safety investigation concluded that the immediate cause of the accident was the failure of the slewing ring bearing, as a result of excessive wear and tear in the outer ring.  This led to spalling of the ball bearings and raceways, which was augmented by metal particle contaminated grease.","Bulk Dry (general, ore) Carrier","Ship remains fit to proceed","13965","[Other]","21454","Solid cargo - Dry bulk","19","0","0","","","","","","","2018-01-23",""

Several attempts were made to free up the anchor fluke which included passing a mooring rope over the crown of the anchor from the outboard side and moving the anchor chain from the forecastle deck with a hydraulic jack. 

Eventually, the Bosun was instructed by the Master to enter the hawse pipe to free up the anchor fluke using the hydraulic jack. In the process, the anchor chain moved and pinned the Bosun against the upper side of the hawse pipe, resulting in his death.

M/V VIRGINIA was owned and operated by VIRGINIA SHIPPING LINES, CORPORATION (VSLC).

Roughly seven hours after departure, while transiting between the waters of El Fraile and Caballo Island, M/V VIRGINIA was gutted by fire and subsequently sank,1.5 NM South West of Corregidor Island, Bataan.  Accordingly, the fire was initially detected coming from the purser’s cabin which allegedly emanated from the roof of the bridge where several Styrofoam containers and plastic drums were stowed.

According to the survivors, the fire continued unabated until the roof collapsed which prompted the fire to cascade downwards to the ship’s upper deck.  The crew mustered and continued to fight the fire.  However, due to thick smoke and rapid expanding flames, the crew failed to extinguish the fire.  The blaze quickly spread on the ship’s superstructure and to all her cargo spaces within a short period of time.  Due to the risk of being trapped, the Master decided to give the order to abandon ship and accepted consequences as a loss event.

Seven crew members were rescued including the Master of the ship; nonetheless, four (4) crew members were reported missing including one oiler who was allegedly confirmed to have perished due to fatigue and hypothermia.  The accident resulted to the total loss of the ship, four missing crew and dumping of approximately 6,000 liters of marine diesel fuel in the environment.

L’Austral arrived off the Snares Islands early on the morning of 9 January 2017.  The passengers spent the morning making shoreline excursions in rigid-hulled inflatable boats, observing the wildlife.  That afternoon the weather became unsuitable for small-boat excursions, so L’Austral rendezvoused with the boats in the sheltered water to the south of the islands to take them back on board. 
While the master was focused on manoeuvring the ship to facilitate the safe recovery of the rigid-hulled inflatable boats, the ship drifted into a 300-metre unauthorised zone, where it contacted an uncharted rock.  The rock pierced the hull in an empty void tank, which flooded with water.  The damaged compartment had little effect on the ship’s stability, and the ship was able to continue to another sub-Antarctic island before returning to New Zealand for temporary repairs.  Nobody was injured. 
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found that L’Austral inadvertently entered the 300-metre unauthorised zone, which the ship was not permitted to enter and in which the charts noted the existence of overfalls, eddies and breakers. 
The uncharted rock was in an area that the Commission considers was not suitable for the safe navigation of ships the size of L’Austral.

At Singapore, the vessel was expected to take bunkers while carrying out some repairs.

On 7 January 2017, while en-route from Taiwan, China to Singapore, the vessel’s crew commenced washing of cargo holds with seawater, in preparation for carriage of grain cargo. The last cargo carried onboard was limestone in bulk. No.1 and No.2 cargo holds were washed without any incident.

On 8 January 2017, at about 0900H, the vessel’s crew began to clean No.3 cargo hold with seawater.

At about 1000H, after the upper aft section of No.3 cargo hold had been washed, the Able-Bodied Seaman detached his safety harness lifeline from the securing point on the platform, and began his climb up the vertical ladder. During this climb, as he was nearing the top of the ladder, he fell backward and down from a height of about 12 metres (m) to the bottom of the cargo hold and suffered multiple injuries.

The Master deviated his vessel’s passage to Qui Nhon in Vietnam, the nearest port, for the injured seaman to seek medical treatment. However, the seaman succumbed to his injuries about seven hours after the occurrence.

The TSIB classified the occurrence as a Very Serious Marine Casualty and launched an investigation.

The investigation identified that the seaman lost his grip of the vertical ladder while climbing. His safety harness was not connected to any strong point or fall arresting device. 

The seaman’s inability to grip the vertical ladder could have been due to the following:

• Wet cargo hold
• Wet gloves worn by the seaman
• Slippery surface as a result of the seawater wash
• Exertion from his climb up the vertical ladder immediately after some physical activities
