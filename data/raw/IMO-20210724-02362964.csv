C02 fire extinguishing was activated to the cargo spaces (holds 1 and 2) and again to the engine room.
At 08:35 hrs, seven crew members were evacuated by helicopter. The ship lay at anchor from 09.15 to 11:20 hrs. At 09:40 hrs a further five crew members were evacuated by helicopter. The vessel was under tow from 11:20 to 15:10 hrs. Towards the end of this period it was noted that the fire had spread to the garage deck.
At 15:10 hrs the ship was again anchored. At 15:50 hrs the remaining crew members were evacuated by helicopter.
During the following four days the ship was on fire, first on the garage deck, later in the accommodation spaces. Since the ship was carrying dangerous cargo (sodium chlorate) she was not permitted to enter port. She was kept under observation and was sprayed with water for cooling from 6th November at 06:55 hrs by the contracted salvage company. On 10th November at about 04:05 hrs a number of violent explosions took place in the vessel, which immediately started to sink.

At about 17:16 hours Eastern Standard Time, a pilot from the Queensland Coast and Torres Strait Pilot Service boarded the ship about 2.4 miles west of Harrison Rock buoy at the western extreme of the Prince of Wales channel. 
After a brief discussion with the Master, the pilot advised that there was insufficient water in certain parts of the Prince of Wales Channel to allow the ship to make a safe passage. It was decided to wait off the channel until the transmitting tide gauges indicated sufficient under-keel clearance to allow the ship to transit the channel. 
At about 17:36 hours, the pilot ordered the wheel be put hard to port, so as to make a turn on to a reciprocal course to await the tide. 
At about 17:54 hours, the ship grounded 0.7 miles north-west of Harrison Rock at the western end of Sunk Reefs. 
At about 21:03 hours the ship refloated under its own power and the passage to Gladstone was resumed.

Early in the afternoon the Chief Engineer observed the Second Engineer to be in physical difficulty in the lower part of the compartment and raised the alarm. He then made several attempts to assist the Second Engineer, entering the compartment without using a breathing apparatus.
Both the Chief Engineer & Second Engineer collapsed in the lower part of the bow thruster compartment. Attempts to rescue the two men were made by the Assistant Engineer, wearing a self contained compressed air breathing apparatus, but he was unable to effect a rescue.
The bodies of the Chief Engineer and Second Engineer were eventually recovered from the bow thruster compartment by members of the Darwin Fire Service.

The ship was shaping a course for Cairns fairway buoy where the pilot of the Torres Strait and Queensland Coast Pilot Service was to be disembarked.

At the same time the Australian prawn trawler Kekenni was engaged in trawling off Batt Reef steering about 135°, at a speed of about 3 knots.

At about 00:35 hours, the two ships collided in approximate position 16°30.0 South 145°40.2 East, about 26 miles north-north-west of Cairns. The visibility was clear with a calm sea and slight swell. The Kekenni subsequently sank and the three crew took to the trawler's dinghy. 

At 00:42 hours Townsville Marine Communications Station received a message from the trawler Prospector reporting the incident and confirming that the Prospector was proceeding to search for the crew. 
The Master of the Jin Shan Hai was called to the bridge, and the ship turned to render assistance.

The three crew members of the Kekenni were rescued from the dinghy by the Prospector
Apart from minor bruises and abrasions the crew of the Kekenni suffered no injury. The Prospector returned to Cairns with the crew aboard.

At that time the weather was calm with slight mist, fine rain and slight winds.

At about 20:00 hours, the wind freshened up. At about 21:30 hours, the wind force increased rapidly to force 7 and the sea became rough. The duty officer instructed the engine room to stand-by engines for immediate manoeuvring and instructed the crew to pay out more anchor cable. However, as the ship was shipping heavy sea on deck the crew were unable to proceed to the forecastle. The duty officer also informed the master and the port authorities of the situation.

At 23:05 hours, the ship commenced dragging anchor. The duty officer used the engines to reduce the strain on the cable and to prevent her from drifting towards a shoal to the north of the ship. However, the ship continue to drift. On 18 April 1991 at 05:00 hours, the ship grounded.

At about 07:20 hours, a tug was despatched to the ship. However,  due to tough seas, the tug was unable to come close to the ship. At about 12:00 hours, the duty officer decided to abandon the ship. While preparing to launch the life saving appliances, an able-bodied seaman was washed overboard.
At about 17:00 hours, the remaining crew were evacuated  by helicopter. The ship declared a constructive total loss

On 13 April in the morning the towing had to be abandoned due to another explosion. Subsequently the wreck partially sunk, approximately 1.5 nautical miles south of Arenzano, west of Genoa. The fire continued for about 70 hours till the whole ship sunk. A third explosion at 5:30 hours, on 14 April caused a release of oil. In totally 8 or 9 explosions happened.

To provide for continued engine cooling, the crew arranged to pump ballast water from a hold and to replenish the water using a second ballast pump. During the night of 30/31 January, the amount of ballast water in the hold exceeded the allowable limit. On the morning of 31 January, a bulkhead separating this hold from an adjoining one collapsed.

The board determined that the level of water in the No.7 hold was not monitored effectively and the bulkhead collapsed when hydrostatic pressure, caused by a ballast water level in excess of the recommended maximum, exceeded the bulkhead’s strength and the allowed limit.
