The pilot on BERGITTA called MSC EYRA on VHF channel 16, when MSC EYRA was in the area off Vengeancegrund L/H. On VHF channel 6 it was agreed to pass port-to-port. This agreement was confirmed at a 2nd communication between the ships.         

The relative speed between the ships was very high especially when taking the prevailing circumstances and conditions into account. Thus the situation developed rapidly from the time when the communication was initiated and until at close-ship-situation developed off Agersoe Flak. 

The ships collided at approximately 2218 hours.

Subsequently, when the vessel passed East Head abeam to starboard, she was about 30m to starboard of her programmed track and the leading light line.  The visibility was good with North Westerly wind of 15 knots and a following spring flood tide.
ARATERE was operating in automatic track keeping mode, commonly referred to by Interislander personnel as 'ANTS TRACK'.  The Chief Officer had the con of the vessel and the Master was present on the bridge for the pilotage through the Tory Channel.  The vessel had a total complement of 292, comprising of 260 passengers and 32 crew.  Her draughts were 5.2m forward and 5.5m aft.
After passing East Head, ARATERE approached the programmed WOP (Wheel Over Position) which would take her onto the next programmed track.  The Chief Officer, who was monitoring the ANTS TRACK, noticed that the XTE (distance off track) was still to starboard of the leading light line, which the vessel was following to reach the programmed WOP.
At this stage, the Chief Officer informed the Master that the distance off track was 40m.  In response, the Master told the Chief Officer that he had seen the cross track error up to 85m with a flood tide.
By reference to the Conning Information Display Unit on the IBS, the Chief Officer continued to report an increase in the distance off track from 60 to 70, and then 80m.  ARATERE's speed was now 20.75knots and the vessel was 320m past her programmed WOP.
When the distance to starboard of Track C had reached 95m, the Master and the Chief Officer realised that on her current heading and speed, the vessel would shortly run aground in Whekenui Bay, Arapawa Island.
In an attempt to prevent this, the Master overrode the ANTS TRACK system by engaging the manual steering control and putting the helm to port.
ARATERE narrowly missed grounding in way of a rock situated to the south of Whekenui Bay.

At 1233, the ship grounded with the entrance beacon bearing 0051/2 degree, at a range of 0.52 miles.

The chief engineer located on the bridge reduced engine speed and commenced the engine room shut down procedure.  The fire in the meantime was about to be fought by the electrician but the assistant engineer relieved him.  At this point the flames were seen to die down and it was reported out about 3 minutes after discovery.

The vessel's emergency plan was followed and the captain had the situation firmly under control throughout.

There were no injuries and damage was limited to minor smoke staining above the engine.

The cause of the fire was a failed low pressure fuel pipe which supplied the fuel injection pump.  The pipe failed because it was ill fitted and was strained; the engine vibration exacerbated this.  The pipe has been forwarded by the DPA for metallurgical examination.

Metallurgical report received on 8 Nov 04 and placed in file.  The report confirmed that the cause of the pipe failure was probably the poor fitting procedure.  Para 3.4 of the conclusion section states that; gouging was found on one side of the spill pipe, where the compression nut had been forced against the spill pipe tubing, and this was further evidence that the pipe had been subject to excessive forces whilst being fitted to the engine.""

At 16:30 hours, the wind grew increasingly more forceful until, within just a few minutes, it had reached 9 Bft. There was a high container stack behind the vessel’s superstructure. This area exposed to the wind led to the stern of the Northern Faith being pushed very rapidly away from the pier. The second Nautical Officer sent a watchman forward to check the lines there while he ran to the aft. Later the watchman was sent to the aft to help the second Nautical Officer. When he arrived at the aft manoeuvring station, he found the second Nautical Officer severely injured and lying on the floor. He informed the bridge by telephone about the incident.

At the same time, the container vessel PUDONG SENATOR departed from its berth at the Eurogate container terminal and was running out of the Waltershofer Hafen on its way towards Rotterdam.
The two vessels collided in the area where the Parkhafen opens into the Norderelbe.  PUDONG SENATOR survived the collision without any major damage and after approval from the VTS Hamburg ran into the Elbe navigation channel and continued its voyage downstream along the river Elbe.  Before Brunsbüttel it was checked by the Waterway Police officers from a boat from the water.  Since no further damage apart from paint abrasion could be seen, the vessel was allowed to continue the voyage to Rotterdam with the provision that it will be surveyed there by the Classification Society.
The special transport vessel ENA 2 carrying a cargo of sulphuric acid was damaged on its port side.  Parts of the outer plating in the foreship area were deformed, water flooded into the forward port wing tank.  In addition, the port Schottel drive in the aft area became inoperable as a result of the collision with PUDONG SENATOR.  However, ENA 2 initially remained floating, continued under its own power without losing cargo into the Petroleumhafen and tied up with a slight list to port at the intended berth.  The Waterway Police and two fireboats of the fire brigade hurried to the damaged vessel. 
The fire brigade tried in vain to keep ENA 2 afloat; its list to port increased further.  At about 19h05, ENA 2 capsized and floated keel upwards in the port basin.  Sulphuric acid now escaped.
In the following days, a salvage firm secured and subsequently uprighted ENA 2.
In the meantime, a large part of the cargo had found its way into the port water.  The rapid dilution of the acid there meant that the major environmental pollution initially feared did not materialise.

One able seaman was hit by the tank hatch of tank 1CS when the tank exploded. He was found later on, badly burnt, just behind the hatch. The Boatswain, also badly burnt, managed to move aft, where he was taken care of by the ship’s crew. The officer in charge of the navigational watch immediately set off the ship’s general emergency alarm, and fire-fighting operations were started without delay by using the foam monitors on the tank deck. At 1505 HRS the fire on deck was extinguished. Distress alerts were transmitted without delay and replies were received both from land-based stations and ships. The master received no response to his request for medical and helicopter assistance. Both involved seamen on deck lost their lives.

The ship entered Magellan’s Strait on 31st May 2004 at 00:54 hours. 
On  2nd June at 02:30 hours LT, as consequence of the weather deterioration, the Captain decided to look for protection and navigated the ship to the Ladrilleros Channel in order to wait for more favourable conditions. 
Later the ship entered Fallos Channel, where the Captain decided to have a beam distance of 3 cables with Punta Sequel Lighthouse, into the Adalberto Channel. Closer to the Punta Sequel Lighthouse the ship had a starboard leeway and the Captain ordered to put all helm to port; however, the ship did not react to the last order, and the Captain ordered full power ahead.
 At about 20:45 hours LT,  after a strong impact was sustained at the bow, the ship had a port listing. The captain ordered minimum speed ahead in order to evaluate the situation and to activate emergency procedures accordingly.
   The ship's condition, after verification,  was the following: grounded, with bulbous bow resting on a submerged rock at SW of the Punta Sequel Lighthouse, with bow in direction to islet Koffert.
    In order to prevent any movement of the ship towards the coast line or rocks in the vicinity as a consequence of the sea current and wind, the Captain ordered ship engine ahead slowly.
   The ship floated alone at about 21:56 hours LT as a result of the wind reduction and flood tide, at that time the Captain ordered that machines be stopped. About 22:00 hours LT with machines and helm movements the ship took distance from the grounding position. 
    No pollution was generated by this accident.
The grounding was due to mistakes made in planning the trip (lack of consideration of the sailing directions and deficient route contro)l.

Some of the crew were working aft on the trawl wires, the skipper was in the wheelhouse and the chief engineer was on the main deck. The engineer noticed that the port main deck floodlight situated on the 4 metre high platform (Figure 1) between the forward masts had a ""crazed"" glass. This was not unusual; a combination of the hot glass and cold sea spray had caused this before, and the engineer was accustomed to changing the glass.

Having obtained a new glass, the engineer climbed the ladder to the platform. He was wearing safety shoes, but no other personal protection equipment. He was not wearing a safety harness, although six were on board and all were in date for test. The engineer informed nobody that he was going aloft.

The engineer accessed the platform through an unguarded gap in the guardrails (Figure 2). The platform (Figure 3) was wet, did not have a nonslip finish and contained several tripping hazards.

He stepped over these, knelt down and rotated the floodlight to remove the damaged glass. The next thing the engineer recalls was a helicopter hovering overhead preparing to transfer him to hospital.

From the subsequent investigation, it was clear that the glass had been replaced and that the floodlight was returned to its original position.

The engineer then either stepped back through the guardrail gap, or fell from the mast ladder onto the wheelhouse roof, landing on his back and cutting his head. No one saw him fall, although the skipper heard him land on the wheelhouse roof.

Sadly, this accident resulted in the engineer severing the lower part of his spinal cord.

The Lessons

While we cannot be sure whether the lack of a non-slip finish, or the open guardrail contributed to this accident, the following lessons should be learned from this tragic accident:

1. Safety harnesses or other restraining devices must always be used when working aloft in accordance with the Code for Safe Working Practices. There should be no exceptions to this rule.

2. Safety chains should be fitted to open accesses in guardrails. If they have to be removed to gain access, they should be re-instated immediately.

3. A non-slip finish should be applied to hazardous working deck areas, or where risk assessments have identified there is a risk to personnel.

4. When working aloft, crew should tell others of their intentions, and they should be aware of any potential hazards.

5. Risk assessments should be conducted where personnel are exposed to dangerous or unusual activities.  ","Fish Catching Vessel","Serious injuries","459","Lloyd's Register (LR)","","FISH","14","","","0","0","0","1","0","0","",""

The ship, equipped with twin rudders, controllable pitch main propellers and a single bow thruster, did not require a tug for the departure. The master, as is common practice on passenger ships, manoeuvred the ship clear of the berth and then, even though this was his first visit to Townsville, kept the conduct of the ship without consulting the harbour pilot. The pilot adopted an advisory role.

As the ship was turning from the harbour into Platypus Channel, part of the approach channel to the port, it grounded on its port side. The ship heeled three degrees to starboard and, after about three minutes, slid clear of the bank without assistance and continued out of the channel.

After it had cleared the channel, the ship stopped for about two hours to check that the hull was not breached and that all machinery was operating normally. Immediately upon notification of the grounding, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) placed a detention order on the ship until the ship’s classification society was satisfied that Astor was seaworthy. When it was confirmed that the hull and machinery were in proper condition the detention order was lifted and the ship then proceeded to Cairns. At Cairns, an underwater survey of the hull was carried out to ascertain the extent of any damage.

The weather was calm with intermittent fog.
At about 04.30 hrs in the morning, the course of the ferry was crossed from the port side by the smaller vessel JOANNA en route from Amsterdam to Falkenberg. As the vessels' course line crossed, JOANNA made a violent turn to starboard and collided with STENA NAUTICA.  Joanna's stem penetrated STENA NAUTICA's plating on the starboard side and tore a hole in the cargo deck space and engine rooms.
Water poured into the engine rooms and since watertight doors were open, large parts of STENA NAUTICA's engine area filled rapidly.  Her power supply and propulsion machinery were put out of action and she lay unsteerable.  The Master decided to abandon ship.
In the vicinity, there were a tugboat and another ro-ro passenger ferry.  The passengers and the majority of the crew were transferred to these and subsequently put ashore.
STENA NAUTICA was towed into port in Varberg. The work of sealing the damage and preventing her from sinking was extensive and took several days.
Nobody was injured.  The cargo including the racehorses on board was saved, but STENA NAUTICA sustained extensive damage.  She was repaired in a shipyard in Poland and returned to service in June 2004.
JOANNA was able to continue to Falkenberg after the collision, with a fairly small leak in her stem.","PASSENGER/RORO CARGO/FERRY","Ship rendered unfit to proceed","19763","Lloyd's Register (LR)","2500","","34","94","","","","","","","","2007-05-03","2008-07-01"

After the loading works had been completed on Sunday evening, the vessel left Eikefet shortly before 09:00h on Monday 19 January 2004, with a pilot on board and proceeded to bunker in Skalevik near Bergen, where she moored at 11:40h.  Four hours later, at about 15:40h, mv ROCKNES continued its voyage, still with a pilot on board, heading for the intended port of discharge in Emden, Germany.
At about 16:23h, mv ROCKNES changed course to port in order to enter Vatlestraumen. At about 16:27h the vessel touched ground with her starboard side in the narrow passage; immediately she developed a list to starboard that could not be stopped.  Within a few minutes mv ROCKNES capsized completely.
Twelve of the thirty persons on board could be recovered alive as a result of the rescue measures initiated immediately.  Three of them were freed from the hull of the vessel floating keel upwards after several hours.
Escaping fuel polluted Vatlestraumen and the adjacent coastline.  The Norwegian Coastal Authority collected a total of 1.291 tons of emulsified water which has been determined to be equivalent to 227,5 tons of IFO 380.
After the rescue attempts were discontinued, the vessel was towed into a bay on Agotnes.  The hull of the vessel was examined and it was decided to upright mv ROCKNES again.  From 17 March 2004 onwards work proceeded on turning the vessel; on 29 March 2004 it was lying upright again.  On 5 April 2004 mv ROCKNES was towed to the Bergen Mekaniske yard at Laksevag near Bergen.  The vessel was inspected and a decision was taken to reinstate it.  To this end mv ROCKNES was towed to Poland for repairs and modifications.  It was initially estimated that the necessary repair works would take more than one and a half years.","Bulk Dry (general, ore) Carrier","Ship rendered unfit to proceed,Pollution,Loss of life","17765","Germanischer Lloyd (GL)","25065","","23","","7","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","2007-05-25","2008-01-22"

The BUGALED BREIZH called the other trawler twice to say that she was capsizing and to give her position, contact was then lost and the vessel went down with loss of all hands; the other fishing vessel raised the alarm.
MRCC Falmouth deployed numerous aerial and maritime rescue resources.  Of the five crew members of the BUGALED BREIZH, two bodies were found on the same day, a third body was found in the wreck when it was refloated.

The catastrophic damage caused resulted in the vessel being declared a constructive total loss (CTL), two crew members were tragically killed and one was injured.

The “Panama Serena” had arrived at Porto Torres on 31 December 2003 with a cargo of Benzene and cut C6 (C6), the Benzene discharge had been complete and the vessel was close to completion of discharge of the C6. All cargo tanks were loaded upon arrival at Porto Torres, except No.4C which was washed, clean and dry.

At approximately 11:55 on 01 January 2004, as the cargo deck watch was changing, the vessel was shaken by the first in a series of violent explosions, which resulted in an intense fire amidships, within the cargo tank area of the vessel.

The duty 3rd Mate and relieving 2nd Mate were handing over the cargo watch in the cargo control room (CCR), which overlooked the main deck at the time of the first explosion. The seaman on duty and the seaman taking over the deck watch were outside on the main deck and were both tragically killed in the series of explosions. The Chief Mate, who was resting in his cabin at the time, was injured.

The Master and the remainder of the crew who were all within the aft accommodation area managed to escape from the vessel by jumping over the stern into the water, then climbing into the stern launch freefall lifeboat, which had automatically launched due to the extreme force of the explosions which wracked the vessel. 

The fire was eventually brought under control by the shore based emergency fire services; however they were unable to save the two seamen o the main deck or prevent extensive damage to the vessel and the terminal jetty due to the intense nature of the fire which followed the series of explosion.

Due to the catastrophic damage caused to the vessel (which can be seen in the photographs attached to this report) it has been extremely difficult to identify the exact cause of the initial explosion; however a number of possible causes were identified and are covered within this report.
