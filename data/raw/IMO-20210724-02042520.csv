The vessel was manned by 23 crewmembers of Greek, Filipino, Romanian and Ukrainian nationalities.
On 13 December 2001, at 0000 the vessel was passing through the Sundra Strait on a heading of 900.
The master was on the bridge during the passage through the strait but at 0125, when there were no ships around his vessel, he went down to his cabin to have a rest. He informed the second officer who was on watch, to call him if he needed him or when the vessel arrived at the Outer Channel.
The second officer was on watch together with a helmsman, who was hand steering the vessel. An able seaman was on look out.
Some time later the AB was requested to proceed to the forward deck for the anti-piracy patrol, leaving the second officer and the helmsman on the bridge.

At 0140, the second officer observed an approaching vessel, 10 miles away. At this time, he could see the red and green navigation lights of the approaching vessel.
When the vessels were about 5 miles apart, the second officer plotted the CPA 0.1 to 0.2 miles. By now only the green light of the oncoming vessel was visible.
He then checked the distance by the Variable Range Marker (VRM) and obtained a distance of 4.1 miles.
At this time the second officer contacted the other vessel by VHF on channel 16 and suggested to change over to channel 6. The officers on both vessels agreed to pass each other port-to-port.
The second officer instructed the helmsman to alter the course 100 to starboard to give more space for the approaching vessel.
The second officer could not see the red navigation light of the oncoming vessel at this time.
According to the CPA on the ARPA, the vessels were going to pass too close to each other in the port-to-port situation.
In view of this the second officer again contacted the other vessel by VHF and also flashed the Aldis lamp at the other vessel to ensure identification of his vessel.
When the distance showed 2.8 miles, the second officer realised that he cannot alter his course more to his starboard, because his ship was heading at P.P. Tidung. He also decided that if he slowed down his vessel, he still would not be able to pass clear of the oncoming vessel.
Therefore, he contacted again the other vessel, which turned out to be the MT SELE PERTAMINA 3006 on channel 16 and advised to pass port-to-port.
The officer on board the MT SELE PERTAMINA 3006 replied that it was ‘OK’ and confirmed to pass port-to-port. At this time the red navigation light of the MT SELE PERTAMINA 3006 was still not visible from the MV ELIXIR.
When at 0.7 miles away the second officer again tried to warn the other vessel by VHF and shouted ‘port to port’. At this time the MT SELE PERTAMINA 3006 started to alter her course to port, turning towards the MV ELIXIR. 
The second officer instructed the helmsman to go hard to starboard.
At 0205, in position 050 51.9’ S, 1060 29.9’ E, the vessels collided. The bow of the MT SELE PERTAMINA 3006 made contact with the MV ELIXIR on the port side in line with No.1 hold.
On feeling the collision, the master came up on the bridge and stopped the main engine. He saw the bow of the MT SELE PERTAMINA 3006 close to the aft port side of his vessel.
And ordered hard to port to the helmsman to avoid a second contact.
The master decided to drop anchor and assess the damage to his vessel.
The forepeak ballast tank, the No.1 hold and the No.1 double bottom ballast tank were flooded giving the vessel a heavy trim by the bow.
The MT SELE PERTAMINA 3006 sustained damages to the bulbous bow and forepeak ballast tank.","Bulk Dry (general, ore) Carrier","Ship rendered unfit to proceed","25056","Bureau Veritas (BV)","44007","","23","","","0","0","0","0","0","0","",""

She was in ballast with draughts 4.3 m Fwd and 5.97 m Aft and was manned by 20 Polish crewmembers.
The intended destination was Ventspils, Latvia via the Great Belt.
At 20:00 hours on 09 December 2001, the third officer took over the watch from the chief officer.
The ship was making 14 knots on a true course of 1230 (T).
The distance to route “H” and Route “T ” junction buoy T-63 was 3.6 Nm. The master was on the bridge at this time. As it was good visibility, he decided to send the able seaman who was on lookout duty, down and stayed with the third officer on the bridge.

Both radars were on and the third officer was plotting and monitoring the ships in the area around his ship.
Ahead of his ship there was another ship making about 14.5 knots 10-150 on the starboard bow.
Two other ships were crossing the MV STANISLAW KULCZYNSKI’S course from port to starboard side, at 0.7 Nm and 0.9 Nm respectively.
At 20:10 hours, the ship crossing on the bow of the MV STANISLAW KULCZYNSKI crossed safely at a distance of 0.3 Nm and proceeded to starboard.
The other ship, 300 on the port bow of the MV STANISLAW KULCZYNSKI, which was now about 1.0 Nm away, changed her course to port.
On this new heading the ships were on a collision course, which was confirmed by the ARPA.
This alarmed the third officer who in turn notified his master.
The master instructed the third officer to sound the ship’s whistle in an attempt to warn the oncoming ship and turned his vessel’s wheel hard to starboard. After some time, when the master realised that a collision was inevitable, he turned the wheel hard to port in an effort to minimise the impact of the collision.
At 20:13 hours in position 540 36.1’ N, 0110 08.0’ E the ships collided, with the oncoming vessel which was the Antigua registered MV ATINA, hitting the MV STANISLAW KULCZYNSKI on the port side close to the engine room bulkhead and hold No.5.
The MV ATINA sustained damages to the port bow above the waterline while the MV STANISLAW KULCZYNSKI sustained damages to the shell plating and engine room bulkhead, also above the waterline. 
The MV STANISLAW KULCZYNSKI proceeded to a shipyard to effect repairs.
The MV ATINA continued on her voyage via the Kiel Canal.

The other vessel was observed in relatively proper time on both vessels. Recordings from the VTS Great Belt showed that KLAZINA VERA was proceeding in that side of the route, where the northbound vessels normally are proceeding. Approx. 3 minutes before the collision, KUNDA began to turn to starboard. At approx. the same time KLAZINA VERA began to turn to port. At the collision KLAZINA VERA was hit by the stem of KUNDA in the starboard side aft. KLAZINA VERA heeled over and sank shortly after the collision. The skipper and a fisherman managed to get out of the sinking vessel. They stayed at the stem, which was still over the water, until they were rescued by the pilot boat from Spodsbjerg.

The ship was manned by 21 Greek, Egyptian and Ghanaian crewmembers.
The MV CAPTAGIANNIS sailed from Kavkaz on 07 November 2001, bound for the port of Sfax, Tunisia.
On sailing from Kavkaz, the vessel’s draught was 10.06 m on even keel and had 198 mt of F.O. and 27mt of G.O.
On the 11 and 12 November 2001, while on passage to Sfax, the ship encountered gale force weather from the South South East and she was rolling and pitching heavily, with water coming over the deck and the hatch covers.
The master altered the course from the intended 2530 to 2200 at position 340 45’ N, 0180 16’ E, to ease the ship’s movements and to try to avoid the bad weather as much as possible.
On 12 November 2001, at 2330, the charts in use on the bridge were changed, that is from B.A. chart No. 176 to B.A. chart No. 3403, which is the approach chart to Sfax.
On 13 November 2001, at 2340, the MV CAPTAGIANNIS ran aground in position 330 26.8’ N, 0110 23.25’ E.
The double bottom tanks were sounded and it was confirmed that there were no penetrations of the hull.
Tugboats were despatched to the scene of the grounding to assist the ship in the re-floating operation.
On 29 November 2001, the ship was re-floated and allowed to proceed under her own power to the port of Sfax, where the cargo was discharged.
After inspection by divers, it was found out that the ship had sustained minor indentations to the hull shell plating and she proceeded to Piraeus, Greece for repairs.

The vessel was bound for San Francisco Do Sul, Brazil. The draught at the time of departure was Fwd. 9.95 m, Aft 9.98m.
On 27 May 2001 at 0800, the third officer took over the navigating watch accompanied by an AB, acting as a lookout. The weather was clear at the time, with visibility of about 4 miles.
At 0800, when the third officer took over the watch, the radars were switched off, as it was already daylight and clear weather. The culture on board was to keep the radar sets off in daylight and good visibility during navigation.
At around 0820 the visibility started to deteriorate suddenly due to a fog bank. The third officer switched on the radar sets and left them to warm up for a few minutes. (The radars normally needed 3 to 5 minutes to warm up)

The vessel’s speed at the time was about 10 knots with 114 revolutions per minute on the shaft.
The third officer switched on the automatic foghorn and went to the radar to try and fine tune the sets.
At this time, the third officer became aware of a vessel coming from the starboard side that was about 0.6 nautical miles away.
He instructed the AB to change over to hand steering and put the wheel hard to port.
Before the MV OLYMPUS started to react to the helm input, the other vessel, the MV SAO SEBASTIAO collided with the bow of the MV OLYMPUS.
After the impact the MV SAO SEBASTIAO almost lost all headway, while the MV OLYMPUS carried on. As a reaction to the impact the MV OLYMPUS rolled heavily to port and by the time she rolled back to starboard the bow of the MV SAO SDEBASTIAO was already abeam her accommodation and she was struck again just forward of the starboard lifeboat, causing damage to the starboard life boat, davits and some railings.
The master of the MV OLYMPUS, who was with the chief officer in the officer’s mess having breakfast and discussing the day’s work program, went up to the bridge and took over command.
Due to the damages sustained in the bow area and paint locker of the MV OLYMPUS, the forecastle caught fire and the chief officer and some crewmembers started to fight the fire, and managed to bring it under control about 90 minutes later.
The collision caused considerable damage to the MV OLYMPUS. The forecastle on the starboard side was heavily damaged and the side shell plating between the forecastle and part of the No. 1 hold was breached by the bow of the MV SAO SEBASTIAO. 
The hatch covers of the No.1 hold were displaced from the hatch coaming and also damaged.
When the vessels made the second contact the starboard lifeboat, davits and lengths of railings of the MV OLYMPUS were damaged. 
During the fire fighting the master assessed the damage sustained by his ship and decided to steer the ship inshore to shallower waters. The master was concerned that should the bulkhead between No.1 and No. 2 hold fail, the vessel would loose her reserve buoyancy and founder.
In this respect he steered to shallower waters with the intention of beaching the vessel if the need arises.
At position 300 30.2’ S, 0500 16.5’ W, the master dropped anchor in 13 metres of water.
The owners contracted a salvage company to salvage the vessel and after the necessary arrangements were made, the ship’s cargo was lightered on to another vessel.
The MV OLYMPUS was later on towed to the San Francisco Do Sul inner anchorage were she arrived on 15 June 2001.
The MV SAO SEBASTIAO sustained minimal damage to the stem with one hole above the waterline on its port bow and the loss of both anchors.

On 25 February whilst heading to Cape St Vincent, the Kristal encountered heavy weather, the condition of weather worsened further as the ship entered the Bay of Biscay.

On 27 February 2001, at 12:25 hours the crew noticed that the Kristal had suffered a complete structural failure and had broken in two, in way of nos. 4 COTs, approximately between frames 114 and 124.

The crew members abandoned the ship safely but in the process of being rescued, the port lifeboat capsized and out of a crew complement of 35, only 24 survived. Seven days later, nine crew members were still missing. 

On 02 March the forward section of the Kristal was blown up by explosives and sunk at the explosives dumping area Fosa de Hercules. On 06 March 2001, about 100 miles north west of La Coruna, Spain, the aft section, whilst under tow in bad weather, listed heavily and sank in about 4,900 metres of water

Before arrival a port side lifeboat drill was scheduled to take place immediate following the arrival and under the command of the chief officer.

At 0715 the lifeboat was ready for launching. 7 crew members were on board the lifeboat and were fastened in their seatbelt. The boat was lowered to a position level with the boat deck, and at that point the hoisting function was tested. The winch motor did not hoist and the drill was therefore abandoned and an attempt was made to hoist the boat by hand. In order to investigate the cause the electrician was sent down to the HI-press room, where the electrical panel board of the davit motor is located. By pushing different contacts at the panel board the winch motor could be brought to hoist in jerks.

Suddenly the winch started to hoist steady and fast and continued hoisting after the davits had reached their uppermost position. Due to the continued pull the wires broke and the boat fell 16 metres down to the sea. One of the crew members was so seriously injured, that he died shortly after, 3 other crew members were seriously injured and the remaining 3 crew members sustained light to moderate injuries.

The investigations following the accident has shown, that by pushing the contacts at the panel board the Proximity Cut-off Switches at the davits, which cut off the current for the winch motor just before the davits reaches their stop position, and the Over Current Control Relay, which cut off the current for the winch motor in case of overload, were bypassed.
