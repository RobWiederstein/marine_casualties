The tug was operated by a Tug Master and an Engineer Officer.
As the tug’s next assignment, to assist in an un-berthing operation at Jurong Island Jetty 1 (OVL1), was in two hours’ time, the Tug Master decided to moor his tug at a mooring buoy at Banyan Basin, rather than going back to the tug operator’s West Coast Base (WCB) station, which would mean a 1.5-hour return trip to OVL1.
At about 0104H, the tug arrived at the Banyan Basin mooring location. The Engineer Officer (EO), who had been tasked to secure the tug to the buoy, fell into the sea while attempting to secure the tug to the buoy. Search and rescue operation was unsuccessful. Two days later, the body of the EO was found in Indonesian waters off Karimun Island, about 19 nautical miles southwest of the Banyan Basin.
The Transport Safety Investigation Bureau classified the occurrence as a very serious marine casualty.
The investigation reiterated the importance of wearing a floatation device/ life-vest while working on-board a vessel. Other factors contributed to the occurrence included the mooring of the tug at a non-designated location and the lack of risk assessment of potential hazards involved in mooring operation, particularly, involving a tug with two-man crew.","Tug","Loss of life,Ship remains fit to proceed","493","Lloyd's Register (LR)","302","","2","","","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","2018-04-30",""

The engine room crew assigned by the Second Engineer to work on the FBB pump comprised the Fourth Engineer (the engineer-in-charge), the Oiler, the Wireman and the Engine Cadet. Pre-job briefing and risk assessments were carried out before the start of the dismantling work.
 
By 1200H the crew managed to remove a number of bolts using appropriate spanners and wrenches. Some of the bolts however were badly seized and could not be removed. To remove the seized bolts, the crew decided to fabricate a tool by welding a metal wedge piece onto the seized bolt, in order to loosen the seized bolt by knocking on the welded metal piece with a hammer. Hot work permits were issued for the dismantling work.
  
At about 1400H, the Fourth Engineer while standing on the engine room tank top attempted to weld the wedge. He instructed the Engine Cadet to switch on the power for the welding machine which was located in the engine room workshop two decks above. At the engine room workshop the Engine Cadet noticed that the fitter was doing some other welding work and his welding cable was connected to the welding machine. Upon being informed by the Engine Cadet of the Fourth Engineer’s instruction, the fitter removed his welding cable and connected the Fourth Engineer’s welding cable to the welding machine. 

This resulted in the fatal electrocution of the Fourth Engineer.

The vessel had completed her sea passage from Narvic, Norway, fully loaded with 163,000 metric tonnes of iron ore, with a draught of 17.5 m.
About 15 minutes prior to the grounding, two pilots had boarded the vessel and proceeded to the bridge where the master, third mate and a helmsman were already in the wheelhouse.
The vessel was proceeding towards the entrance of El Dekheila Channel, following course alternations recommended by the pilot. The pilot s orders were given directly to the helmsman. The safety investigation revealed that the course recommended by the pilot was different from the one prepared in the passage planning. Moreover, during the navigation of the Channel, the vessel was navigated close to shallow areas, leading to the vessel running aground and remaining stranded. Soundings and subsequent in-water inspections revealed no water ingress in any of the vessel s double bottom tanks. No injuries were reported.
Lightering operations commenced on 25 November 2016 and were completed on 27 November 2016 at 1435.

Shortly after, the MERIDIAN was able to manoeuvre clear again in a sternward direction. This contact with the bulbous bow left no visible damage on the MSC DIANA. However, it did result in indentation with cracking on the starboard side of the MERIDIAN. The MERIDIAN's crew was able to stop the slight water ingress that followed. The shell plating of the NEWYORKER was dented several times but no cracking was caused. The collision with the pier caused heavy damage to the MERIDIAN's fore section.

After continuous foundering on her starboard quarter aft moving abeam, the ship started to heel initially 15° to port. M/V Foxhound failed to recover her upright position. Due to the slanting of the ship and added weight from her over stowed cargo, the cargo lashing on deck no. 1 to collapse, causing several of the cargo logs to roll over from the cargo deck. The ship continued to list to 35° to port prompting more logs to roll and causing the forward port side post to collapse. 

The Master of M/V “Foxhound” ordered to stop engine and immediately sent a distress message to the ship’s agent in PNG, subsequently, he activated the ship’s radar transponders (SART/EPIRB).After one hour, the Master gave the order to Abandon Ship and the crew boarded the lifeboat located at the ship’s starboard side. After several hours, the crews were later rescued by M/V “Cosco Shanghai”

On 22 October 2015, M/V “Cosco Shanghai” arrived at Port Botany, Sydney, Australia with all Filipino crew. M/V Foxhound was later found to ran aground at the position LAT 05° 18.162” S LONG 147° 11.095”E off the east coast of Long Island in the Vitiaz Strait. There was no reported oil spill or fatalities involved in the incident. On 14 November 2015, the Office of the Administrator (OADM) received an electronic mail (email) from Captain Md. Nafizul Hossain, Acting Executive Manager, Marine Operation Division, National Maritime Safety Authority (NMSA) PNG, about the incident.

The NMSA-PNG, likewise, notified the owners and operators of M/V “Foxhound “that it will conduct an independent Preliminary Investigation pursuant to Section 165 and 166 of the Merchant Shipping Act (MSA) of 1975 in order to ascertain the causes and consequences resulting from the abandonment of the ship by its crew whilst on a passage from FONSEN Log Pond in West New Britain to Kimbe.

It was also stated in its letter-advisory that the ship will be under DETENTION until the completion of the Investigation and a certificate of seaworthiness has been issued by the vessel’s Classification Society (Nippon Kaiji Kyokai) to its satisfaction.

While underway, the crew members took the opportunity to carry out planned routine maintenance tasks, which they would otherwise have limited time to carry out in port, if any. The freefall lifeboat launching system required monthly greasing in accordance with the manufacturer s instructions.It was hence decided to task the bosun to carry out the necessary greasing.One AB was to accompany him throughout the duration of the job.
The bosun was very experienced and found no problem to climb the freefall lifeboat davits and work around it. The safety harness hook was attached to the lifeboat railing. At one point in time, the bosun moved to relocate himself to a different position on the davits. During this process, he lost his balance and fell down from the davits to the poop deck, in close proximity of the mooring winches.
Considering the height of the fall, the bosun was disembarked and transferred to a hospital in Italy for further medical assistance and necessary treatment. The bosun was diagnosed with back injuries and had to undergo a surgical intervention before he was actually repatriated.","General Cargo Ship","Serious injuries","5857","Bureau Veritas (BV)","","","15","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","",""

Esto lo designa el Primer Oficial con el fin de poder inspeccionar dichos tanques pues ya estaba en la programación de mantenimiento. 
El Contramaestre le indica visualmente al personal de cubierta (marinos y cadete), los registros y escotilla que deberían abrir.

Luego, uno de los marinos nota la ausencia, encuentra al cadete y al contramaestre desmayados dentro del espacio, no toma las precauciones pertinentes para entrar ni da la voz de alerta y entra para realizar el rescate pero no fue satisfactorio pues queda inconsciente dentro del lugar, siendo 3 víctimas dentro de dicho espacio. 
Es entonces donde otro de los marinos que se encuentra en el cuarto de compresores, retorna a la cubierta y nota la ausencia del personal; decide aproximarse a la escotilla que se encontraba abierta, notando que habían 3 cuerpos desmayados dentro del espacio, dando la alerta al primer oficial.

The failure occurred when the ferry was approximately four minutes away from the berth and traveling at 12 knots. The master who had control of the ferry attempted to diagnose the cause of the failure and use the ferry s starboard shaft controllable pitch propeller and bow thruster to bring the ferry back under control. Using a combination of the manoeuvring controls and stopping the port shaft from rotating the ferry eventually came to a stop in the water after having run over a marina pontoon. As the ferry s forward motion ceased the starboard side of the hull came in to contact with submerged rocks, damaging the bilge keel and causing indentations to the hull plating. When manoeuvring back towards its intended berth the ferry s starboard propeller became entangled in the upturned pontoon mooring chain. The ferry eventually berthed at the linkspan on the jetty and the passengers and vehicles were discharged. The ferry remained alongsde for three days during which an underwater survey was completed to assess the damage and to identify the cause of the failure of the port controllable pitch propeller.

In the course of the trip, on September 25th around 05:05 UTC, from the tugboat warned that the towing speed was considerably reduced and they stopped seeing the lights of the towed barge. When getting light that morning, the crew found that the towed vessel had capsized. Around 09:35 UTC on the 25th the barge sank. CONCLUSIONS All indications are that the barge CAPTAIN FIRST capsized as a result of a loss of stability caused by the progressive flooding of several of its empty starboard side compartments. It is possible that this entry of water was produced through the very mouths of access to these spaces, either because they were open or because they did not maintain their watertightness throughout the trip. This hypothesis would also explain why the collapse occurred after the capsize.Other causes of flooding cannot be ruled out, as there is no record of the state of the plates inside the hopper or the state of the internal partition bulkheads. It cannot be ruled out either that given the age and the type of stresses endured by the internal structure and plates of the hopper possible structural cracks allowed flooding to progress through the different spaces of the vessel.It is not possible to be sure of the causes of the flooding, since the barge could not be inspected after the accident because it sank to great depths.","Dredger","Ship rendered unfit to proceed,Total loss of the ship","346","","","","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","2019-10-25",""

La descarga termina a las 21:30 LT del 5 de septiembre quedando el buque en lastre y en preparación para su zarpe a Pajaritos, México. A las 23:00 LT abordan dos Pilotos pertenecientes a Houston Pilots quienes asesorarán al Capitán de la nave en su tránsito de salida del Houston Ship Channel. La maniobra de desatraque también involucra a dos remolcadores posicionados por la amura y cuadra de babor. A las 23:42 LT se comienzan a soltar las líneas y a las 23:59 el Piloto a cargo de la maniobra ordena máquinas Dead Slow Astern. Transcurridos escasos minutos, el Piloto y el Capitán se percatan que el buque está desarrollando una velocidad mayor de la esperada y a pesar de sus intentos por aplicar medidas para detener la viada del buque, el buque golpea un pilote de amarre ubicado en el Inter-Continental Terminal (al otro lado del canal de navegación). Como resultado del impacto el Aframax River sufre fracturas en su casco babor, particularmente en un tanque de combustible (2 FOT). La fricción del contacto enciende el combustible derramado ocasionando un incendio que prácticamente envuelve el 50% del buque. Gracias a la acción combinada de la tripulación, remolcadora y personal de los terminales, este incendio se controla y el buque es finalmente llevado a la sección de lay-up en las cercanías, en donde atraca a las 03:16 LT del 6 de septiembre de 2017. El accidente no deja heridos, pero sí daños materiales.

Officer left the water. The Deck Rating remained in the water alone and he was observed to complete a series of breathing exercises before proceeding
to free dive under the length of vessel.
The Deck Rating was required to be back on duty at 20:00 hrs and his absence was noted at about 20:20 hrs when he failed to respond to radio calls. This consequently led to the vessel being searched to ascertain his whereabouts.
About 20:45 the vessels Master was informed that the Deck Rating could not be located on board and that there were concerns that he had not returned
after having gone swimming earlier that evening. The Master ordered a detailed search of the vessel, informed the local Emergency Services and contacted the vessels ISM Management Company using the 24h emergency telephone number.
Local search and rescue authorities conducted a search of the area using a search and rescue helicopter and other vessels. An underwater search was also carried out but poor visibility hampered the operation. The search was suspended about 02:00 hrs on Tuesday morning.

Maria was under pilotage and was preparing to berth at Laboratory Wharf. Union was safely moored alongside at Magazine Wharf, whereas FV Angela Arcella was also alongside at Ras Ħanzir. 
On her final approach to the quay, Maria failed to stop in time and struck Angela Arcella. The bulbous bow penetrated the fishing vessel’s hull below the water line. Soon after the allision, Maria gained considerable sternway and struck Union on her stern. Consequently, the mooring ropes parted and Union was set adrift in the harbour. Maria was finally brought under control and secured at Magazine Wharf. Meanwhile, another pilot boarded Union and with the assistance of a tug boat, berthed her at Laboratory Wharf. 
Both Maria and Union sustained structural damage. Angela Arcella reported progressive flooding and consequently lost her reserve buoyancy and foundered at its berth. No injuries and pollution were reported as a result of this accident. 
The Marine Safety Investigation Unit (MSIU) concluded that the immediate cause of the allision was the slow response of the controllable pitch propeller (CPP) system. Recommendations have been made to the managers of Maria and Transport Malta’s Ports and Yachting Directorate with respect to the CPP system, vessel movement and pilot/master communication and interaction, and timely communication of berth plans.

This caused the vessel to be anchored to the seabed and unable to manoeuvre. Efforts by the crew to clear the rope were unsuccessful and, after about 30 minutes, a deckhand decided to jump into the sea and try to cut the rope from the propeller. However, a strong tide swept him away from Our Sarah Jane and he was subsequently lost. During the attempt to rescue the deckhand, another member of the crew jumped into the sea, but quickly got into difficulty and had to be recovered back on board the boat.
The investigation identified that:
• The deckhand jumped into the water despite the vessel’s skipper instructing him not to do so; and the deckhand was possibly under the influence of drugs.
• Both crewmen almost certainly suffered from cold water shock.
•The attempted recovery of the deckhand from the water was impeded by the vessel being anchored by its fishing gear and because a lifebuoy attached to a buoyant lifeline was not readily available.
• The 2nd crewman’s entry into the water to assist the deckhand was well intentioned but the risks involved were not properly considered.
• Emergency drills could potentially have improved the response to the fouled propeller and also identified the shortcomings in the availability of the lifebuoys.
A recommendation has been made to the vessel’s owner aimed at ensuring that lifesaving equipment is readily available and improving the crew’s ability to deal effectively with emergency situations.","Fish Catching Vessel","","5.2","","","","","0","","1","","","","","","2017-03-17",""

PATRICIA's crew consisted of the master who fished alone. Weather conditions were good, with a north easterly wind direction and a steady wind speed in average of 7-9 m/s and moderate seas. During the voyage, the master did not need to pay much attention to wind and waves and the fishing boat was operated with autopilot. The fishing boat's three cargo hatches and engine room door were closed. Shortly after half past two in the afternoon, PATRICIA was about 1-1.5 hours (about 8.5M) from the port of Sandhamn. The master was in the wheelhouse and was only wearing work pants and a thin shirt. The wheelhouse door was in an open position. For some reason, due to a sound or a feeling according to the master, he looked astern and saw that most of the working deck was covered by sea water. The sea water, or the wave as the master experienced it, came from the starboard side. The master turned off the autopilot and reduced the speed. He did not take any other immediate action, but noted that there was an abnormal amount of water on deck in the view of the prevailing sea condition. After two or three minutes according to the master, PATRICIA started to heel over more to the starboard side. It became clear to the master that the situation was no longer under control and the boat was about to capsize. At the same time as the master stepped out of the wheelhouse, PATRICIA started to capsize all the way to starboard. The master did not have time to send any emergency message via VHF radio or phone. The master ended up in the water along the fishing boats port side as the boat now was floating upside down. The master managed to reach a loose floating ball fender and a plywood board that he managed to get tied up on. The master's partner was planning to meet the fishing boat at the port. When PATRICIA did not arrive at the stated time and attempt to contact the fishing boat did not succeed, she felt that something serious must have happened and she alerted the Joint Rescue Co-ordination Center, JRCC. The Maritime Administration's SAR helicopter started and flew towards PATRICIA's last known position. After a while, the helicopter saw a larger piece of wreck like a floating table top. When the helicopter approached this object, it was discovered that a person was tied on the board. The master was winched up to the helicopter and was conscious, but heavily chilled. The helicopter flew to Karlskrona where an ambulance met for further transport of the master to hospital. The investigation has not been able to determine the exact cause of accident. The Accident Investigation Authority estimates that the most likely cause of loss of stability, is a combination of successive water ingress into the hull of the fishing boat together with a limited amount of seawater on the work deck at the end of the event. After that, the fishing boat completely lost its stability and capsized. Contributing to the event is the lack of ship inspection system for ship in the current size, and therefore there is no control that the boat complies with current safety and stability regulations.","Fish Catching Vessel","Pollution,Ship rendered unfit to proceed,Total loss of the ship","10","","","","1","","","","","","","","","2020-12-09",""

The ferry became wedged under a pier and its wheelhouse was demolished, but there were no serious injuries and there was no pollution. The MAIB investigation identified that: The confined nature of the ferrys normal berth at the pier afforded little space in which to safely abort an approach in the event of a mechanical malfunction. The collision resulted from a loss of control of the ferrys water jet propulsion. The cause of the loss of propulsion control could not be identified but it was almost certainly due to a mechanical failure within the systems hydraulic circuit. The potential for similar mechanical failures to occur in the future cannot be discounted. Injuries to passengers were avoided by them being seated and warned of the impending impact. Following the accident, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) withdrew the ferry's passenger safety certificate and the ferry was sold by its operator. In view of the action taken, no recommendations were made.","Passenger Ship","Ship rendered unfit to proceed","13.6","","","","3","15","","","","","","","","2020-01-28",""

Preliminary information indicated that FV Lu Rong Yu 58398 was towing a fishing net with another boat, FV Lu Rong Yu 58397,off Xiangshan coast in the East China Sea.  At about 0341, while making an alteration of course to starboard to prevent a collision, it was alleged that Catalina snagged the fishing gear, which resulted in Lu Rong Yu 58398 capsizing in position 29 32.23 N  123 35.88 E, with the loss of all persons on board.  At the time, the weather was overcast and the visibility was poor.  Both the second mate and able seaman who were on duty on the bridge, reported that they were unaware of any physical contact with the vessel.
During the course of the safety investigation, the MSIU was informed by the Maritime Safety Administration of the People s Republic of China (MSA) that paint samples on the underwater portion of Catalina matched with the chemical characteristics of the paint on Lu Rong Yu 58398. Moreover, the safety investigation found that the bridge on Catalina was not properly manned to match the exigencies of navigation in restricted visibility and the observation of traffic by radar was inadequate.","Bulk Dry (general, ore) Carrier","Ship remains fit to proceed","40485","American Bureau of Shipping (ABS)","74432","","20","0","0","","","","","","","",""

The skipper and crew, who had been working long hours before anchoring late the previous evening, had woken suddenly as the vessel was sinking rapidly by the bow. They were able to escape to the aft deck, activate the emergency position indicating radio beacon (EPIRB), and to don lifejackets. However, they were unable to inflate the liferaft as they abandoned the vessel.
At 0232, an alert from Louisa’s EPIRB was detected by a geostationary search and rescue satellite and forwarded through the Cospas-Sarsat system to the United Kingdom Mission Control Centre (UKMCC). The UKMCC relayed the alert to HM Coastguard, but confusion over terminology resulted in delays before search and rescue units were sent to the scene.
When Barra lifeboat arrived in Mingulay Bay, the crew were able to assist one crewman, who had swum to the shore and climbed onto rocks. They located the uninflated liferaft and beside it found the skipper and one crewman unresponsive and face down in the water, despite wearing approved abandonment lifejackets. The other crewman had attempted to swim to the shore and was found, also face down and unresponsive, still wearing his lifejacket, close to the beach. The skipper’s body was lost as the lifeboat crew attempted to recover him and remains missing.","Fish Catching Vessel","Ship rendered unfit to proceed","32","","","Other cargo","4","0","0","3","0","0","0","0","0","2017-10-31",""

Around 14:07 UTC, the two vessels collided at a point about 4 miles from the SSW green light at the port entrance. As a result, the sailboat suffered the mast breakage in three pieces, which fell on the deck and into the water. There was also a small waterway in the coastal area. The merchant suffered no apparent damage. After recovering the mast and controlling the water entry by its own means, the P/C CHARLIE IV was towed by the salvage vessel SALVAMAR DIPHDA to the port of Cambrils for repair. There was no personal injury among the occupants of the sailboat and the crew of the merchant ship. CONCLUSIONS The P/C CHARLIE IV ended up being boarded by the M/V ISA for failing to maintain adequate surveillance of its route in the period of time since its last beating leg off Cape Salou and the collision, as required by COLREG Rule 5. The skipper, sitting on the wheel on the windward side of the boat during this time, never saw the merchant approaching on a collision course, because he was being concealed by his own sail, and he did not regularly monitor this dead zone of vision. When he saw the merchant appear behind his sails, collision was inevitable. The M/V ISA ended up colliding with the P/C CHARLIE IV for not detecting its presence or not respecting the rules of passage of the COLREG. If it is true that the sailboat was detected early, the M/V ISA should have maneuvered to guarantee it a safe passage through its bow, it had multiple options to achieve this in the situation in which they were approaching. Something as simple as contacting the skipper via VHF and agreeing to slightly correct the course a few degrees to port to always lick the wake of the sailboat and allow it to pass through its bow in a safe crossing of both ships. However, the absence of communication and warning attempts and the continuity of course and speed after the impact, allow us to conclude that they did not exercise effective surveillance in the bridge of the M/V ISA that could have detected the supposed changes in course of the vessel as required by COLREG Regulation 5. No Safety Recommendations have been produced but some generic ""lessons on Safety"" have been added at the end of the Report.","Bulk Dry (general, ore) Carrier","Ship remains fit to proceed","21387","American Bureau of Shipping (ABS)","","Dry bulk","19","0","0","","","","","","","2019-10-28",""

While transiting in the vicinity of Pakiputan Strait, the ship allegedly encountered failure on her main generator which prompted her to automatically discontinue her propulsion. Due to the prevailing sea current in the area, the ship started to drift towards the shoreline of Paradise Beach Resort in Samal Island, Davao Del Norte. In order to prevent the ship from running aground, the Master ordered the starboard anchor to be dropped at approximately 3 shackles. Apparently, the anchor allegedly hit an underwater cable.

The damaged underwater cable was identified to be a submarine electrical cable owned by the Davao del Norte Electric Cooperative (DANECO) supplying power from the mainland to Island City Garden of Samal (IGACOS). According to the Coast Guard Davao Station Report (CGSDVO-0316-025) dated 17 March 2016,  M/V Ecuador dropped her starboard anchor in order to prevent the ship from grounding due to the prevailing sea current. Tug assistance from nearby M/tug Schedar operated by Harbor Star Inc. was utilized to assist and prevent M/V Ecuador from drifting towards the shoreline.

By 0955H, the ship’s propulsion  was restored and she started to heave up her anchor. The crew of M/V Ecuador noticed that an underwater cable had been snarled in the fluke of her anchor and the crew tried to detach it with the assistance of the tugboat. After several attempts, the crew successfully disengaged the cable allowing the ship to proceed to her next port of call at around 1000H.On or about 1335H of 17 March 2016, representatives from the DANECO reported the incident to Coast Guard Sub-Station (CGSS) Sasa that the incident has caused power outages in IGACOS.","Container Ship (Fully Cellular)","","1720","Filipino Vessels Classification System Association, Incorporated","1935","","18","0","","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","2017-01-12",""

Suspecting a fault in the low level alarm switch, the second engineer instructed the third engineer to overhaul the alarm low level alarm switch on port side HFO storage tank in order to identify and rectify the fault. At about 1710, immediately after dismantling the low level alarm float switch, fuel oil escaped almost instantaneously from the opening. It was immediately evident that the tank from where the low level alarm switch had been removed contained a significant volume of fuel oil and there was enough static pressure for the leaking fuel oil to reach the main engine exhaust manifold.

The third engineer tried to mount the fuel oil low level alarm back to the tank in an attempt to stop the fuel oil leak.

As the vessel would stay for long time at the anchorage, it was decided to collect water from the Air Condition’s drains.  The 2/E and the Oiler (victim) were ordered by the C/E to find the position of the Air Condition’s Drain Pipe so that they can connect it to a tank for collection of the drain water. They were wearing Safety Harness, a Safety Helmet and Overall.     
In order to find the Air Condition’s Drain Pipe, they climbed up a ladder next to the Engine Control Room (ECR) and then through a platform on top of an Air Duct, to reach the pipes’ network. The Oiler stayed on the top of the Air Duct and the 2/E went to the Air Condition Room. The 2/E knocked the pipes and the Oiler distinguished the right pipe (Air Condition’s Drain Pipe) from the noise made by the knocks. 
 At about 09:30 hours the work was completed and the 2/E ordered the Oiler to go down to the Engine Room Platform where the ECR is situated.  He proceeded down first.  At about 09:35 hours, the Electrician on his way to the ECR found the Oiler with his  head and shoulders hanging out of a Void Space’s vertical Manhole. He was bleeding from the mouth and was calling for help.   
The Electrician called immediately the 2/E and the C/E. The 2/E pulled the Oiler by the shoulders out of the Void Space and placed him on the Engine Room Platform. The C/E informed the Officer of the Watch (OOW) on the Navigation Bridge, who informed the Master. All crew was informed about the accident via public announcement. The 2/O carried the stretcher and the First Aid Box.  They placed the Oiler on the stretcher and transferred him into the ECR. Then, he was transferred from the ECR to the ship’s Hospital. The 2/O checked his pressure and administered to him Oxygen.      
 At 10:30 hours, the pulse of the injured Oiler could not be measured and the blood pressure was zero. Personnel from the Malaysian Maritime Administration and from the Malaysian Marine Police boarded. The Oiler was transferred ashore by boat around 18:00 hours.  Post mortem examination results: Causes that led to death: “Polytrauma Secondary Fall From Height”.

Shortly after 2300, a rower was swept overboard by a large wave and he soon became separated from the boat.
The seven rowers remaining on board were unable to stop the boat, and they eventually lost sight of him.
The following day, French and Portuguese fixed wing aircraft and a cargo ship searched the area, but the missing rower was not found. The rowing boat's crew were recovered on board the cargo ship leaving the abandoned rowing boat to drift. The cargo ship arrived in Brazil, 6 days later.
The investigation identified that:
●● The rower had not been adequately tethered to the boat.
●● The boat’s low gunnels1 afforded little protection against a person falling overboard.
●● The rower became separated from the boat because the leash he was wearing
detached from his ankle and the boat could not be stopped in the prevailing conditions.
●● The rower’s likelihood of being found was reduced because he was not wearing a lifejacket or a personal locator beacon.
●● The boat was operating on a commercial basis but it was not certified as a commercial vessel.
Ocean rowing is a niche sport that has grown in popularity, but the boats used and their operation, is largely unregulated. They are also vulnerable when on ocean passage, where assistance is rarely immediately at hand. Although elements of best practice for the sport have been established over the years, these have not yet been formalised or applied consistently.
Recommendations have been made to improve the governance of UK registered ocean rowing boats and ensure minimum safety standards on board those that are commercially operated.
A recommendation made to the rowing boats operator is aimed at improving the safety of its boats on ocean crossings in the future.","Other Activities Ships","","1","","","","8","0","","1","0","0","0","0","0","2017-03-20",""

After a short period, they realised that the boat was taking on water and they could no longer control it properly. The men managed to guide the boat into the trees on to a spit of land with the river flowing over it like a rapid. The boat was tipped over as it grounded on submerged rocks and was pushed into the trees and the men were thrown into the shallow water. The strong current forced the upturned boat against the trees and the leg of one of the men became trapped under the capsized boat and another man's feet became trapped in undergrowth.
In very challenging circumstances and after an extended rescue operation by several emergency services the men were rescued. One of the men was unresponsive and was later pronounced dead at Limerick University Hospital. Post mortem results state that the cause of death was due to drowning.

Both vessels had taken pilots to transit the Eastern anchorages in the Singapore Strait to their repective destinations. At the time of collision the pilots of both vessels had already disembarked from the vessels earlier. 

The vessel MV ‘Castle’, a bulk carrier, was leaving the Singapore Eastern anchorage heading Eastebound for a voyage to Miri, Malaysia, with a pilot on board after some repairs to the deck equipment and taking bunkers.  

Whereas, the vessel MV ‘Dumun’, also a bulk carrier was leaving the Singapore Eastern Special Purposes ‘A’ anchorage after taking bunker fuel oil and transitting with a pilot towards the Singapore Strait Westbound Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) on her intended voyage for Djen Djen a port in Algeria, North Africa.

At the time of the collision at 0225 hours LT on 22 January 2016, the weather was fine and the visibility was good and clear with light breeze. The speed of the MV Castle was about 7.8 knots. The other vessel MV Dumun’s speed was about 8.5 knots. On board both the two vessels, the radars were in operation and in working order

The two vessels were approaching each other on a crossing situation. The MV Dumun was on the port side of the MV Castle. At 0210 hours when the pilot disembarked from the MV Castle, the MV Dumun was about 2 nautical miles on the portside of MV Castle. MV Dumun still had a pilot on board. At 0224 hours, MV Dumun dropped off the pilot. By this time the two vessels were 0.2 nautical mile apart. It appeared that collision was imminent. Both vessels were communicating with each other on VHF Channel 14 on what avoiding action to take to avert collision. However, it was too late for the two vessels to avert collision.

At about 0225 hours, both vessels coliided. The MV Castle sustained damage to the port of her bulbous bow. On the MV Dumun, she sustained damage to the shell plating on the starboard quarter in way of No 1 settling tank and service tanks. There was some bunker fuel oil leaked into the sea. The vessel was not taking in water. No one on board was injured. The vessel proceeded to anchor at an anchorage near Batam, Indonesia.

The vessel’s sinking resulted from a flood in the engine room that had started sometime between 0900 and 1000. The skipper and crewman abandoned into a liferaft shortly after they became aware of the ingress of water and were rescued by a nearby fishing vessel. No efforts were made to stem the flood and the vessel foundered approximately 4 hours after it was abandoned. There were no injuries and no pollution. The pipeline’s owner later arranged for sandbags to be placed on the seabed between it and the wreck to prevent damage to the pipeline.
The cause of the engine room flood is unknown but it was probably caused by a failure within a seawater system or sea valve. The investigation identified that:
•
The engine room’s bilge alarms sounded in the wheelhouse and were not heard by the skipper and the crew who were working on the deck. Consequently, the engine room had been flooding for up to 1 hour before the crew were alerted.
•
The rate of the flooding would have been slowed by the operation of the electric bilge pump and possibly by stopping the main engine.
•
The effectiveness of the crew’s response to the flood was probably reduced because they did not routinely conduct emergency drills.
•
The prompt abandonment and notification to the coastguard and vessels in the area reduced the risk to the lives of the crew.
This accident indicates that relevant guidance and the lessons from similar accidents were not being sufficiently heeded. In the accident, the wheelhouse was left unattended for a prolonged period and the crew were not practised in reacting to a flood on board. In addition, they did not wear personal flotation devices while working on deck and did not don lifejackets when abandoning the vessel.
Initially, the two crew of the vessel were unaware of the flooding as they were both working on deck when the engine compartment bilge alarm activated. The alarm was in the wheelhouse which had been left unattended for over an hour. 
Once the crew discovered the flood in the engine compartment, the alarm was raised and without further investigation in to the cause of the flooding they abandoned ship in a well executed manner. The fishing vessel finally sank after four and a half hours. 
The crewmen were safely recovered from their life raft by another fishing vessel that responded to the distress call. There were no injuries and no significant pollution.","Fish Catching Vessel","","51","","","","2","0","","","","","","","","2017-02-27",""

She was sailing along the Northern coast of Taiwan, China, towards Keelung. Her distance from the nearest land was about 5 nautical miles. The weather condition at that time was passing showers with moderate sea condition and long moderate swell. MV GARNET was rolling moderately. At about 0105 hours (Local Taiwan Time) in estimated position Latitude 25˚ 21’ North, Longitude 121˚25’ East, the Chief Officer, Mr. Arif Rachmad Hidayat, who was the watch keeping Officer at that time was found missing. The duty AB (Mr Ammad Helmi) who was on lookout duty together with the chief Officer at that time could not locate the Chief Officer after he was last seen walking out of the bridge to the port side bridge wing, 10 minutes ago. As the vessel navigation needed attention and the Chief Officer could not be located, AB Ammad Helmi, called the Master immediately. The Master came to the bridge and took over the watch. After ensuring that the vessel was safely on track, he mustered his crew to carry out a thorough search onboard for the missing Chief Officer. The Search Parties could not locate the Chief Officer onboard. Fearing that a Man Over Board (MOB) had occurred, the Master went on a reciprocate course and continue to Search the sea area. Ship’s spotlights were directed to the sea level in an attempt to locate the Man Over Board. MOB procedures as per company safety management procedures were carried out. After searching for over 3 hours, in the last known area where the Chief Officer was last seen, the missing Chief Officer was not located.

The Master contacted the company’s DPA and the Coastguard. At the same time, the ship broadcasted an urgency message seeking vessels around the vicinity to keep sharp look out for a man overboard. The Master back tracked the ship’s route and carried out a search of the sea area but did not find any sign of the missing Chief Officer. 

At the time of the incident, the vessel was fully loaded with bulk sand and gravel (20514 M/T – see Annex 10) from Xiamen, China, bound for Keelung, Taiwan, China. The owner and management of the ship are based in Keelung, Taiwan, China.

After a first unsuccessful attempt to turn it off, the skipper sent a Mayday on channel 16 of VHF warning of his situation and returned with the crew to try to extinguish the fire. Meanwhile, SAR Company SASEMAR deployed its means of aid while two other F/V, which were in the vicinity, came to the distress call of the F/V CANALECHEVARRIA.The fire was finally extinguished by the crew, so the skipper requested the F/V to be towed to safe port.The fishing vessel was towed by the rescue vessel (R/V) MARIA DE MAEZTU to the port of Bermeo (Vizcaya), where it arrived at 09:00 hours on January 17th.CONCLUSIONSThe most likely cause of the fire was a short circuit caused by the contact of the containment wire mesh of a hydraulic hose with the terminal or cable body connected to the positive terminal of the ship's dynamo. The hose was previously weakened by rubbing against a ledge or metal edge, having lost material from its protective cover at the point of friction and causing the double steel mesh to be exposed. The relatively small size of the area in which the hose ruptured leads one to think that the point of friction had to be a metallic edge or similar, close to the breaking point, like the flat terminal of the positive terminal of the dynamo.The short circuit, by melting the metal of the double mesh, caused rupture of the inner layers of the hose and made possible the leakage of the hydraulic oil under pressure that contained. This, together with the high temperatures produced by the short circuit, much higher than the flash point of the oil, caused it to burst into fire.The decision of the skipper to disconnect the hydraulic machinery was determinant for the fire to run out and to be extinguished.The underlying causes or factors contributing to the accident were:1) The installation of the hose that caused the accident was done improperly. The person who performed the hose replacement should have done so in accordance with industry recommendations for these facilities. In this case, the installer did not consider two problems:a. The existence of free parts of the hose that, with the vibration of the ship, rub against parts of other equipment and pipes, andb. Installation of the hose was done too close to electrical conduits.2) Result of the above, it is evident the lack in the operation of the ship of an effective maintenance and inspection system.","Fish Catching Vessel","Ship rendered unfit to proceed","107.4","","","","5","0","0","","","","","","","2019-11-19",""

The vessel was with 11 crew on board. The vessel had sailed towards the port of A Corua from Great Sole fishing area. The Chief Engineer witnessed the water ingress and, alone, immediately initiated all efforts to contain and reduce the flooding, with no result. The crew sent distress calls and abandoned the vessel on the liferafts.At 21:06 UTC on the same night, SASEMAR's main MRCC received communications from several international MRCCs, which had received a distress call by medium wave radiotelephony from a ship near the Spanish coast. Minutes later, at 21:12 hours the MRCC Finisterre managed to establish communication with the F/V through the Maritime Communications Centre A Corua, being informed that the vessel had a waterway and was sinking.SASEMAR immediately mobilized ships in the area while deploying of its own means, with the result that the survivors were rescued by a SASEMAR helicopter without personal misfortune. The trawler sank in position 44 09,9' N 008 40,8' W, to 400 m deep. CONCLUSIONS In view of the evidence found and the information available, it must be concluded that: 1) According to the eyewitness account of the facts, the water leak was caused by the breakage of the main sea chest valve, in its union with the box of the port sea chest. 2) There could have been an area on the top plate of the sea chest housing or on the sea valve flange, whose material was weakened or corroded by cracks and/or rust.3) Thickness measurements did not detect weakening on the upper surface of the housing; therefore, it is assumed that the problem must have been found in the soldering of the flange to the sea chest or in the connection of the flange to the valve. However, due to the random nature of the ultrasonic measurement technique, it cannot be ruled out either that there was a region of the upper surface of the sea intake, connected to the flange, which was in poor condition and whose state would have gone unnoticed in the inspections carried out. 4) These measurements, moreover, only guarantee that the thickness of the plates is maintained, and do not give information on the state of the structure in edges, weld seams or assemblies such as a flange, so it is necessary to carry out an effective visual inspection on these elements, which could not be carried out by the layer of cement deposited on top of the sea intake.5) The upper part of the sea opening was covered with cement. Interpreting the declarations of the first mechanic, this layer also included the flange and the immediately connected part of the valve:""the water flowed between the cement and the valve"". However, based on the evidence available, it is concluded that this layer necessarily had to be less than 100 mm thick. 6) As a consequence of the previous point, any problem of corrosion or weakening that could occur in the upper plate of the sea intake, in the welds, and in the structures that would settle on it would be hidden from the visual inspection of the crew and the successive statutory recognitions. 7) The chief engineer took approximately 85 minutes to sound the alarm, when the situation was practically lost. It would have been better to have alerted the rest of the crew first so that the first mechanic would have been able to get help and the rest of the crew would have been able to take more time to call for help and leave the ship.8) While the both skippers did not follow the procedures established in the GMDSS, it is considered that the combination of the nerves inherent in the situation together with the use of inappropriate equipment, such as survival suits with mittens, meant that the skippers misinterpreted what was happening: that with mittens they were unable to operate the 5 seconds required to trigger a distress alert by DSC on any of the equipment. By mistakenly thinking that the equipment was not working they asked for help through an obsolete system as it was calling for the frequency of 2182 kHz in Medium Wave.9) The sinking probably took place when the flooding progressed towards the fishing park and, from here, presumably by some opening made when installing the ice machine towards the hold.","Fish Catching Vessel","Pollution,Ship rendered unfit to proceed,Total loss of the ship","262","","","","11","0","0","","","","","","","2019-11-19",""

The bridge was manned by the chief officer and a cadet. A canal pilot was also on the bridge. A 2-3 Bft south-easterly wind which was slowly turning to the south-west blew in the early hours of the morning. Inter alia, snow and black ice warnings had been issued for the Rendsburg-Eckernfrde area. There was snow and freezing rain during the night. Wind forces of 4-5 Bft with gusts of 6-7 Bft were measured at Rendsburg after 0600. The air temperature stood at about 3 C and there was light rain. The EVERT PRAHM approached the railway bridge at Rendsburg in darkness at 0635. Her speed over ground (SOG) was about 8.8 kts. The transporter bridge suspended below the railway bridge was on the northern bank of the Kiel Canal at the time. In addition to the operator, there was also a passenger on the transporter bridge. The EVERT PRAHM kept to the middle of the fairway and was just short of the railway bridge when the transporter bridge set off toward the southern bank. Despite the EVERT PRAHM executing a full astern manoeuvre combined with hard to port, it was not possible to prevent the collision. The transporter bridge struck amidships against the hatch, was briefly snagged, rotated, and then released again. It then struck the starboard wing before scraping over the wheelhouse, dragging the antenna, radar and stern mast with it in the process. The EVERT PRAHM sailed gently onto the southern embankment at canal kilometre 62.5. She freed herself unassisted by means of a stern manoeuvre. She then sailed into the Kreishafen of Rendsburg and made fast there at 0715. As a result of the accident the Kiel Canal and the railway bridge at Rendsburg were closed to maritime traffic and to rail traffic respectively. The transporter bridge was severely damaged due to the collision and partially torn out of the rail track. It was stuck over the middle of the Kiel Canal. The operator was seriously injured due to the collision. The only passenger on the transporter bridge was also injured. With the assistance of the canal ferry MEMEL, both people could be rescued from the transporter bridge and taken to hospital. The emergency responders managed to re-engage the transporter bridge and move it to the southern side of the canal by about midday.","General Cargo Ship","Serious injuries,Ship remains fit to proceed","1598","[Other]","2398","","7","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","2","2021-02-15",""
