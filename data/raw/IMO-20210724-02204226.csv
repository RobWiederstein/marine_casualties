A 12:30 heures, le commandant a ordonné une rectification d'assiette du navire par exécution d'un certain nombre de mouvement de ballast. Cette exécution a été conduite de telle manière qu'il en est résulté une gîte si importante qu'elle a entraîné la décision d'abandon du navire vers 16:00 heures. Le navire a ensuite été pris en charge par une entreprise de sauvetage qui l'a volontairement, avec l'accord de l'armateur, échoué sur la plage de Barfleur au nord du Cotentin, allégé de l'eau qu'il contenait et d'un certain nombre de conteneurs, puis remorqué au Havre où il est resté en réparation près de deux mois.

Although she was holed and started to take water immediately, she was moved astern and clear of the designated navigable span before coming ahead in an attempt to pass through an adjacent span. As she did so her bow sank and came to rest on the river bed on top of the housed barrier gate. The gate was effectively put out of commission until such time as the vessel was successfully refloated and the majority of her lost cargo removed.","Dredger","","3110","","","","","","","","","","","","","2011-12-05",""

Navigation of the ship was under the conduct of a pilot. 
After clearing the berth at 09:54 hours, the ship was steadied on its first heading, and sea speed was ordered. When the Pilot was satisfied with the ship’s position and course, he looked at and discussed documents relating to new procedures for ships with the Master. Course was adjusted due East of Cape Heirisson in accordance with the track on the ship’s chart. 
After passing No. 9 beacon the Third Mate called the Pilot’s attention to the fact that the ship had passed No. 9 beacon and No. 8 beacon should have been on the starboard bow. The Pilot checked the position and realised that the ship was heading for shoal water and was standing into danger. Although action was taken to alter course away from shoal water, Pine Trust ran aground at full sea speed at about 11:13 hours, off No. 8 beacon in Denham Channel. 
Initial attempts to refloat the ship using the engine were unsuccessful. A Salvage Master was appointed and, on 16 October 1997, further attempts were made to refloat the ship with tug assistance. The vessel was refloated at 23:45 hours that day, but lost her port anchor and ten shackles of cable as she came off the sandbank. 
After refloating, the tug was cast off and the ship anchored again for a diver’s inspection, in the presence of a Surveyor from the Australian Maritime Safety Authority and a Class Surveyor. Nobody was injured as a result of the incident and there was no damage to the hull, nor was there any pollution. Once it was established that the vessel was seaworthy, the voyage to the discharge port was resumed.

The voyage had been at reduced speed due to machinery problems. It had no cargo to discharge and remained in Townsville to complete repairs. On 12 October 1996, the ship was still lying at no. 6 wharf in Townsville, awaiting spares for the main gearbox. 

The 53-year-old Master was due to pay off from the ship on 15 October and to return to his home in Denmark for leave. On the evening of Saturday 12 October, he and his friend of long standing, the Chief Engineer, went ashore for a farewell dinner. They started the evening with drinks at an hotel near the docks, then went into town for dinner and finally to another hotel before returning on board Arktis Grace at about 21:45 hours that evening. 

The Chief Engineer boarded the ship first, while the Master paid the taxi driver. Shortly afterwards, the crew heard a loud crash and felt the ship shudder. The gangway was found tipped on its side and the Master was seen floating face down in the water between the ship's side and the wharf. 

The Chief Engineer and a crew member jumped into the water in an attempt to save him. The Master was a big man weighing about 140 kg and, despite their efforts, he was later found to have drowned.

The Skipper and Deckhand, who had both been engaged in drop-line fishing during most of the day, had gone to bed shortly before 22:00 hours. 
At about 22:45 hours, both men were woken by a loud bang and violent movement and they realised they must have been hit by another ship. Climbing into the wheelhouse, they were unable to see anything through the windows, so they went out on deck and the Skipper opened the engine room hatch to check for flooding. Both men then looked upwards and saw, close on the port quarter, the accommodation lights of a ship. The ship passed close by to port and moved off towards the east without stopping or making radio contact. 
Teresa was found to have sustained considerable damage to the bulwark at the bow. As the anchor rope had snagged the timber on the port bow, the rope was buoyed and cut loose and the Skipper decided to return to Esperance. 
The partly laden, 26,066 tonnes deadweight, Cypriot flag bulk carrier Atlantis Two sailed from Esperance Roads anchorage at 17:36 hours on 28 September 1997, bound for Thevenard, South Australia. After clearing the approach channel, the Master kept the ship to seaward of the outlying banks of the Recherche Archipelago. No other ships were sighted during the evening and, at 23:45 hours when 13 miles south by east of Termination Island, course was altered from 122 to 090. 
Late on 29 September the Master received a telex message from the ship's operators, informing him that Atlantis Two was suspected of being the ship that had collided with the fishing ship Teresa at 22:50 hours in the vicinity of Termination Island. The Master asked the Third Mate if there had been a collision, or if he had seen the fishing ship and the Third Mate responded in the negative to both questions. 
When Atlantis Two berthed at Thevenard on the morning of 1 October 1997, the ship bore a recent contact mark on the hull, low down on the starboard bow. Under scientific examination, particles of red paint taken from this contact mark matched the hull paint of Teresa and particles of paint deposited on the damaged bow of Teresa matched the boot-topping paint of Atlantis Two.

At 07:04 hours, NOL Crystal passed NW10 beacon and, within a minute, entered a fog bank. The ship’s speed was reduced and the ship’s whistle sounded. A little later the whistle of the inbound ship could be heard as it passed clear to port. The fog was very thick.
The ship grounded at about 07:28 hours on a heading of 315°, in position 26°56.3’ South 153° 11.9’ East, with NW8 beacon bearing 021 x 0.57 miles. NOL Crystal refloated without assistance under its own power that afternoon at 14:15 hours. After ensuring that the ship’s watertight integrity was intact, the ship was permitted to continue its voyage. Nobody was injured and no pollution resulted from the grounding.

It had completed a voyage in ballast from Taichung, Taiwan, China and was preparing to load a cargo of 58,200 tonnes of Australian coal for the return voyage to Taichung.
At about 1030 that morning, a fire was discovered on the lower bridge deck by the crew. The fire rapidly gained a hold and filled the accommodation and the bridge with thick, black smoke. In an early attempt to tackle the fire, the Messboy was burned and suffered a broken ankle. An inbound passing vessel noticed smoke rising from the accommodation of Ming Mercy and notified the Port Kembla Signal Station. The pilot launch was sent to Ming Mercy to investigate and, on arrival, learned of the fire. The shore authorities were notified by the pilot launch and, at 1125, the tug Korimul left Port Kembla with the first team of 13 firefighters from the NSW Fire Brigades. After some difficulty boarding Ming Mercy with all their equipment, via the pilot ladder, they commenced firefighting operations at 1232, entering the accommodation in an attempt to locate the seat of the fire.
A helicopter was despatched to Ming Mercy and, after landing on the hatch covers, flew the injured Messboy to Wollongong hospital. Hampered by intense heat from the bulkheads and steel decks, the fire brigade was unable to prevent the fire from spreading upwards to the upper bridge deck. Due to the heat, firefighters had to work in relays of 20 minutes. The weather deteriorated and, to enable relief crews of firefighters to be exchanged on Ming Mercy, another helicopter was employed running a shuttle service. With the aid of a thermal imaging camera, the fire was eventually brought under control at 1928 and, at 2045, the fire was reported as out.
The forward end of the lower and upper bridge decks was severely damaged by the fire. The bridge suffered extensive smoke damage and buckling of the steel deck. All navigation, control and communications equipment was rendered unserviceable through damage to electrical cables in the decks beneath.

The Pilot disembarked outside the port limits and the ship proceeded on her voyage which was destined for Dunkirk in France via a recommended route to Suez. The courses which were determined by the Master relied upon the advice given by WNI Ocean routes Inc. USA.  
On 31 July 1997, the ship was reported to have struck the Muirfield Seamount (75 nautical miles South West of the Cocos Islands) and then come adrift. A Mayday was sent out which was relayed  by RCC Australia to ""All ships"" via Perth Radio and it was picked up by the M.V. ""British skill"" at 05:52 GMT on 31 July 1997.

At 08:17 GMT the Mayday was sent out Relay was cancelled as the crew had reported that the ship was no longer sinking.
At 10:08 GMT the Mayday Relay was re-broadcast as the crew had reported that the ship was sinking. 
At 10:48 GMT the ship British skill was asked by RCC Australia to proceed to the casualty to render assistance. 
The crew or the ship Goodwill were recovered from their lifeboat in position 13 deg. O3 min. S and 96 deg. 06 min. E which was approximately  9 miles to the North West of Muirfield  Seamount  at 18:00 GMT on  31 July 1997. The stranded ship was later sighted by the ship British skill bow down close to the grounded position.

The British skill proceeded with the Goodwill's crew of 21 persons to a position 3 miles north to a position 3 miles north the Cocos Islands were they were transferred to a 53 foot ship RJ Hawke and subsequently landed on Cocos island in the company of Detective Sergeant Shaun Connelly.

All the 21 persons from the Goodwill were saved

On 6 May, after the ship had rounded Cape Leeuwin, the ship's orders were changed again and the ship diverted to Wallaroo in the Spencer Gulf, before calling at Port Adelaide. 
On the afternoon of 8 May, Western Winner entered Spencer Gulf. The ship continued on passage, expecting to arrive at the Pilot ground at about 22:30 hours. After dark, the ship experienced rain squalls and restricted visibility. 
At about 22:10 hours, the ship ran aground with Tiparra Reef light bearing 128x 1.2 miles in position 34 03.2' South 137 03.2"" East. 
Ballast was jettisoned and at about 13:45 hours on 9 May, the ship refloated without assistance and, under its own power, cleared the reef and proceeded to the anchorage off Wallaroo, dropping anchor at 15:30 hours. 
No injuries were incurred by any of the crew and no pollution resulted from the grounding.

The Skipper was on watch in the wheelhouse and had noticed, on the radar, a ship coming up from astern, shaping to pass clear on the port side. 
Suddenly, at about 00:40 hours, there was a loud bang and a jolt and the Skipper was thrown to the deck on the port side of the wheelhouse as Exterminator rolled heavily to port. Pulling himself back to a standing position, the Skipper saw the hull of a large ship, in a light condition, passing up the fishing ship’s starboard side. As Exterminator rocked as a result of the initial collision, it came into contact twice more with the hull of the other vessel. 
The Skipper put out a number of calls on VHF16, but received no response. He reported the collision to AMSA, then, after contacting the owner, returned to Eden to assess the damage. 
The Liberian tanker Unisina had sailed, in ballast, from Gore Bay, Sydney, on the morning of 24 April 1997, bound for the FPSO Cossack Pioneer, located on the Northwest Shelf. 
At midnight on 24 April, the ship was in a position 20.5 miles east of Green Cape, making good a speed of 11.6 knots on a course of 196. Shortly after 00:30 hours, the officer of the watch started altering course slowly to starboard for a ship, which he considered to be northbound and crossing from starboard to port. After about five minutes, the officer applied hard to starboard rudder, then port rudder, in an apparent attempt to avoid a collision.

After Salome had been manoeuvred clear of the berth, Wambiri was instructed to accompany the ship on a slack line until the Pilot was satisfied he had steerage way. 
When the order was given to let go the tug, before Salome’s crew could lift the eye off the bollard, weight quickly came on the towrope, the Tug master misinterpreting the signal to slack away as heave away. The towrope parted in the eye and, recoiling, struck one of the tug’s integrated ratings, who suffered severe internal and external injuries.

At this time the Australian bulk carrier River Embley was on a south bound loaded passage approaching Piper Reef some 150 miles to the north.  The navigation was under the direction of a licensed Reef pilot. 
At about 21:00 hours, the three warships were approaching Heath Reef from the South and River Embley was approaching the reef from the north. The depth of water in the area meant that River Embley was obliged to keep to the eastern side of the two way route and pass about 3 cables off Heath Reef. VHF contact between those on the bridge of HMAS Fremantle and River Embley was established and the message passed that River Embley was a deep draught ship and the distance the Pilot intended passing off the Reef. The ships were closing at about 28.5 knots on nearly reciprocal courses with the first two of the three patrol ships crossing ahead of River Embley. 
A few minutes after 21:00 hours, the lead patrol ship HMAS Fremantle crossed ahead of River Embley, followed by the second ship in line, the third altered course to pass between River Embley and Heath Reef. HMAS Fremantle made a number of slight alterations and, at about 21:08 hours the rudder was put 20 to starboard. The patrol ship collided with River Embley. There were some slight injuries sustained aboard the patrol boat as a result of the collision, but nobody on either ship was seriously hurt. No pollution resulted from the collision. 
Damage was sustained to the port side of the patrol ship and some damage was caused to the hull plating close to River Embley’s bow and further aft in way of number 3 ballast tank.

In ballast, the 20,297 tonnes deadweight ship had a calculated draught of 4.1 m forward and 5.67 m aft. The anchor was weighed at 06:40 hours and at 07:00 hours the Duty Harbour Master boarded to pilot the ship to its berth. 
After an exchange of greetings and brief formalities, and with the telegraph on full manoeuvring speed, the Harbour Master steadied the ship on a south-easterly course, to pass about 300 m seaward of the Pimple Buoy, an orange marker buoy protecting the wave-rider buoy to the north of the entrance channel. His intention was to alter course to port tightly around the Pimple Buoy, into the entrance channel. 
Due to a loss of concentration, the Harbour Master overshot the intended alter course position, and as soon as he realised this, he ordered ""hard a port"". However, when the ship had turned through about 45, a shudder went through the ship, followed by a second shudder a few seconds later. 
The ship continued to make way and tests showed that both the steering gear and the main engine were fully functional, so the ship was berthed as planned. However, underwater inspections by divers on 14 March revealed substantial damage, with hull penetration into double bottom ballast tanks beneath holds 2 and 4. There had also been an ingress of water into No. 4 fuel oil tank, but no pollution occurred. 
After temporary underwater repairs had been carried out, Aikaterini L sailed from Geraldton in ballast on 19 March, bound for Singapore to undergo permanent repairs

Using one of its own cranes, the ship was discharging a general cargo of steel products, including bundles of steel pipes, from no. 2 hold and tweendeck. 
At about 07:40 hours, the sixth load of steel pipes, for that morning, was being discharged onto the wharf by no.1 crane, a 12.5 tonne capacity crane situated on the aft end of the forecastle on the ships centreline. The crane was being driven by one of the waterside workers. 
The load, weighing approximately 8.6 tonnes, consisted of 18 lengths with diameters varying up to 273 mm. As the load reached the side of the ship, there was a violent jolt and a bang as the slew bearing failed, then the crane fell from its pedestal into the port tweendeck of no. 2 hold. The jib struck the port bulwark, setting it down and out from the ships side, while the body of the crane hit the inboard edge of the port hatch coming, before rotating through 180 and finishing up, upside-down, in the tweendeck. 
The driver was able to climb out through one of the broken cab windows and up the ladders, out of the tweendeck to the main deck, before the effects of shock caught up with him. He had fallen, in the cab of the crane, approximately 17 metres into the tweendeck from the cranes position on its pedestal. 
An ambulance was called and the crane driver and a waterside worker acting as the hatchman, also suffering from shock, were taken to a medical clinic but were not detained. The crane was severely damaged and the badly twisted jib had to be cut up to remove it from the ship.

As No.2 hatch was clear of containers, the Agent had informed the Master that the Pilot would be taken off by helicopter. The Master had queried this, but was assured by the marine Pilot that there was ample room at No.2 hatch for safe helicopter operations. 

At 00:45 hours, 25 February, the marine Pilot asked the Master to have all the deck lights switched on and for No.2 crane to be topped and swung out to port in readiness for the helicopter. These requests were complied with, No.2 crane being topped and slewed to maximum, the hook also being raised to ""cut-out"" position. When this had been carried out, the Pilot informed the helicopter that it was safe to approach the ship from the starboard side. 

The helicopter landed on the starboard side of No.2 hatch at 0105, when the ship was in the vicinity of S1 and S2 buoys. The marine Pilot went down to the deck and boarded the helicopter, fastening himself into the starboard front seat, next to the helicopter pilot. 

The helicopter lifted off the hatch, hovered briefly, tilted and started to move forward, across the hatch, towards the port side. It then started to climb, accelerated and, according to those watching and to their concern, it banked to the left. There was then a loud bang as the main rotor blades struck the hook block of the topped No.2 crane. The helicopter started to rotate, the tail rotor also striking the hook block. The helicopter then flipped upside down and fell to the sea, about 20 m from the ship's side. 

The Master immediately informed Gladstone Port Control, started to slow the ship down and mustered the emergency lifeboat's crew. As soon as way was off the ship, the lifeboat was launched and sent to the area of the accident. 

A local fishing ship was first on the scene, rescuing the helicopter pilot and recovering the body of the marine Pilot. A marine rescue boat from Gladstone was able to retrieve the upturned helicopter.

The ship had just completed a voyage in ballast from Singapore and was preparing to load a cargo of Australian wheat for Inchon in South Korea. 
At about 08:15 hours on the morning of Saturday 22 February, the Bosun, with the two deck cadets and two seamen set to work transferring used dunnage lying on the hatch cover of No.3 hold, to the space between the break of the forecastle and No.1 hatch. The plan was to partly deballast No.3 hold for maintenance. 
The Bosun and the two cadets went to unlash the forward gantry crane. This done, the senior cadet remained in the starboard driving cab while the Bosun, the junior cadet and the two seamen slung the dunnage. On completion, the Bosun and the two seamen alighted from the port side of the hatch cover, while the junior cadet alighted on the starboard side. The two seamen then went forward, and the Bosun, having received an ""all clear"" signal from the cadet on the starboard side, signalled the driver to move the gantry forward to No.1 hatch. 
After the gantry crane arrived at No.1 hatch and lowered the dunnage, the Bosun noticed that the junior cadet had not arrived up forward. He walked aft on the starboard side and found the cadet, apparently unconscious, lying against the hatch coaming of No.2 hold. The crew carried him into the crew's recreation room in the accommodation and the Chief Officer started to apply CPR. 
Shortly afterwards, on unzipping the overalls of the cadet, it was found that his abdomen had burst open and it was concluded that he was dead. 
The post mortem revealed that he had died from shock and haemorrhage following multiple crush injuries. 
The incident was investigated by the Marine Incident Investigation Unit under the provisions of the Navigation (Marine Casualty) Regulations.

As a result of the collision the STOLT STRAY suffered a full fracture in way of No 1 Port Cargo tank, approximately 3 feet above the waterline 1/2"" by 6 feet resulting in the loss of about 20.73 metric tons of pyriolisis gasoline. No cleanup was necessary as the light oil either evaporated or was quickly dissipated by the swift current of the river. The damage to the AGRI-7977 was minimal. Upon survey of the STOLT SPRAY it was determined that the vessel had lost her rudder during the transit. No personnel injuries or loss of life were associated to this casualty.
